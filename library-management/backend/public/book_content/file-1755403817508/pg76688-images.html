FUNDAMENTALS OF FICTION WRITING
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION
</h3>

<p>
Living in so complex a civilization, we
generally fail to realize how complex have
become our mental habits.  We have come
more and more to think upon complexities
until, for the most part, the more elementary
facts, processes and approaches are slighted
or omitted as beneath the high development
of our minds.  However learned our thinking
may be, its foundation must be elementary
thinking, and, if elementary thinking is
neglected because it seems too elementary for
attention, the result is likely to be unsoundness
of the whole structure because it has
been erected on unsound foundation.
</p>

<p>
Add to faulty thinking habit the human
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
tendency to accept as established what has been
handed down to us by our thought predecessors,
dead or contemporaneous.  Progress
can be made only to the extent this tendency
is overcome by chance or guarded against.
Guarding against it requires particularly the
close scrutiny of elementals.
</p>

<p>
It is particularly unfortunate that, the
specialists of course being the most complex
thinkers of us all, we have allowed our habit
of specialization to leave to them more and
more the guidance of general thought, thus
drifting further and further from elementary
methods of thinking.
</p>

<p>
The more thoroughly you analyze modern
thinking methods and their results, the more
evident becomes the damage done.
</p>

<p>
Simplicity is the key, but, being rather
proud of our complexity and advancement,
we have become such strangers to simplicity
that we even distrust it when we meet it.  It
is most pitiful of all that a mere outward
show of complexity gains more respect than
does a simple essential unadorned.  Yet it is
true.  Almost automatically simplicity
produces in us a reaction of contempt, a feeling
that our highly developed minds have long
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
ago passed on beyond such childish matters.
We are too advanced to bother over the
elementals and the result too often is much
frantic "progress" along wrong paths.
</p>

<p>
In the course of my editorial work it
impressed itself on me more and more that
there was somewhere unsoundness in both
the editorial basis of criticism and the writers'
basis of creation.  Being afflicted with the
prevalent complex method of thought, it was
only gradually that I came to suspect that the
unsoundness traced back to some of the
elementals all of us seemed to be taking for
granted.  My suspicions have grown the
stronger during the years of "laboratory"
work, at some points ripening into convictions,
so that in this book intended to be of
practical service to writers of magazine
fiction they will inevitably show.  They must,
therefore, be labeled in advance as departures
from the usual dicta laid down, so that
the reader can make allowance accordingly.
</p>

<p>
While my personal history is unimportant,
some of the details that may indicate, or that
seem to have influenced, the theories developed
have place in this book as guide-posts
in valuing or discounting it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
</p>

<p>
It is, for example, only fair to make plain
in advance that I am probably far less
familiar with books on how to write fiction than
are most beginners who may read this book,
and probably know—or remember—less
concerning the dicta of critics and other
authorities on literature in general.  On the other
hand, in view of the probable reaction to
some of my unacademic views, I claim the
right to state that these views do not result
from lack of academic training.  Also a brief
statement of my experience as editor and
writer seems called for by way of warrant for
my venturing to advance any theories at all.
</p>

<p>
I have been an editor more than twenty
years, a magazine editor for nearly twenty,
serving on seven widely different periodicals—general,
specialized and fiction—<i>Chautauquan,
Smart Set, Watson's, Transatlantic
Tales, Delineator, Romance, Adventure</i>.  At
intervals during that time I have contributed
fiction and articles to <i>Everybody's, McClure's,
Bookman, Country Life, Delineator, Smart
Set</i> and half a dozen others.  Previous to this
there were nearly three years as editor of a
country weekly and two years of teaching
English and literature in high school.  I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
specialized in English at one university and
added some graduate work in fiction writing
at another.
</p>

<p>
As a child my home influence was decidedly
literary, even to a point that might be
designated "highbrow," with the natural
flavoring of science rather to be expected in
a house largely occupied by my grandfather's
microscopes and shelves of specimens.  In a
word, my early training was decidedly
academic, and as a "cub" I came to the magazine
"game" spelling "literature" with a very large
capital "L" and with more than the usual
cub reverence for books and magazines and
all that pertains thereto.
</p>

<p>
Like the majority of magazine editors, I
found that my first task was to shove most of
my academic training and point of view into
the background, making of them an accessory
rather than a guide, and adopting an
altogether new scale of relative values.  A few
months accomplished the greater part of the
change, but it required years to develop
suspicion of that new and commonly accepted
scale, to ripen the suspicion to conviction and
to build up a third scale to take its place in
my work.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
</p>

<p>
Before entering the magazine field, I
remember only one questioning of precepts and
tenets.  About 1900 I refused to read any
more authors "for style," realizing I was
against my will absorbing too many of their
individualities, Stevenson's sentence-rhythm
in particular imposing itself on my literary
efforts to a decided degree.  "Style is the
man" seems to have been one of the textbook
statements that sank in deepest, and it
gave me courage to rebel against another of
its kind.
</p>

<p>
In my college course three things stand out
as strong in influence.  All were encountered
in work of the thesis class conducted by
Professor Joseph Villiers Denney with a sound
judgment and breadth of view that were
bound to be stimulative and give permanent
value.  First, laboratory experiments upon
the class itself showed us, to our great
surprise, the tremendous degree of variation in
individuals as to the quality and degree of
their imagination-response to the printed or
spoken word.  I have met few writers or
editors who had any conception of this variation
or who had even given the matter a thought,
yet it is of basic importance to both.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
</p>

<p>
The second idea outstanding from my college
course is the explanation of the psychological
appeal of fiction given by George
Henry Lewes to the effect that man finds
enjoyment in fiction because by following the
fortunes of the hero or identifying himself
with him he can attain vicariously the
perfections and successes he can not attain in real
life.  I have not seen it for twenty-four years
and may have distorted it, but the idea as
stated has been the one acted upon.
</p>

<p>
Third, there was Spencer's economy as a
basis of rhetorical theory.  I remember nothing
whatever about it except that he included
economy of the reader's attention.  To what
extent this phase of his idea is responsible for
my own theories I do not know.  Memory tells
me I recalled it only after working out my
own, but it is reasonable to hold it a cause
though an unrealized one.
</p>

<p>
<i>Analytics of Literature</i>, by L. A. Sherman,
made a decided impression on me during
college or in the years immediately following.
Undoubtedly I gained much from it, but at
present I am unable to state its content in any
but the most vague way and can not detect
any but academic influences from it, though
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
in this I may be doing it serious injustice.
De Quincey's <i>On the Knocking at the Gate in
"Macbeth"</i> made vivid the use of relief
scenes.  From some book by Brander Matthews
I learned that the short story should
have only one point.
</p>

<p>
Five years after college I read Tolstoy's
<i>What Is Art?</i>  Read it with interest,
resentment, bewilderment and enthusiasm.  It was
the first real blow to my unquestioning
acceptance of all the usual canons of art.  The
impress was tremendous, but, quite in
keeping with my miserable memory, the only
definite, abiding impression I can identify is the
emphasis laid on simplicity, with the
corollary that creative work must reach peasant
appreciation if it is to be classed as art.
Years later I came to attach more and more
importance to simplicity, arriving at that
attitude by paths leading from practical
experience—laboratory work, as it were, paths that
to my vague recollection seem not at all those
of his approach, but I can make no exact
measure of the extent to which Tolstoy may
have done my thinking for me or at least
influenced it.  Probably the influence is far
greater than I realize.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
</p>

<p>
In any case, the above are the <i>total</i> of the
outside influences.  It is, of course,
impossible for any one to live in contact with his
fellows in a world filled with type and
opinions without absorbing ideas from others,
but in the sense of influences sufficiently
definite to make conscious impress I can add
nothing to the above list.  In nearly twenty
years, if I have read any book or article
dealing with the philosophy of literature I do not
recall the title or the occasion.  Five or six
years ago I read a third or half of a book that
taught the writing of fiction, but laid it down
because it was too difficult for me to
understand and seemed not in accordance with my
own ideas.  I have never read any other text
on fiction writing, though I have spun the
pages of a number of them to gain a general
idea of methods and theories, finding only
the usual ones.
</p>

<p>
This lack of reading authorities was at first
due to lack of time, but for years I have
carefully avoided the influence of others' theories
to the best of my ability so that I should not
be diverted or forestalled in an effort to work
out my own.  Naturally, most of the accepted
theories and methods are current because
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
they are sound, but there is a minority of
cases in which a dissenting view seems
warranted.
</p>

<p>
My warrant for dissent is that to a very
great extent the main faults (other than those
due to lack of natural ability) in the fiction
submitted to magazines seem directly due to
faults in accepted theories and methods.
These faults in theory and teaching may be
roughly summarized under two heads:
</p>

<p class="hang">
(1) Assigning to readers theoretical
reactions based on traditional editorial
and critical precepts instead of basing
editorial precepts on actual reactions
of readers.  In particular, lack
of emphasis upon preserving the
illusion.
</p>

<p class="hang">
(2) Overwhelming writers with demands
of technique and academics and
thereby doing all possible to ruin
individuality and real ability.
</p>

<p>
For getting data on the first of these points
I have been exceptionally well situated.
More than any other magazine on which I
have served, more than the half dozen others
under the same roofs, more, so far as I can
judge, than any other magazine I know,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
<i>Adventure</i> gets definite, concrete response
and criticism from its readers.  So far as the
male sex is concerned, probably no other
magazine has a more generally representative
audience, ranging through all classes
from the highest to the lowest brows.  The
great number of letters and talks resulting
from this keen personal interest of its
readers in the making of the magazine has been
invaluable in giving its editor, for more than
ten years, the actual, specific reactions of
readers, as opposed to the theoretical reactions
that accepted editorial theories assign
to them.
</p>

<p>
The overemphasis on technique and academics
I consider the most harmful factor
at work in the field of American fiction, from
both the literary and the magazine point of
view.  I can claim no special equipment for
speaking on this point other than a decidedly
academic training followed by over twenty
years of practical laboratory work, and
arrival at conclusions by abandoning all accepted
precepts and going back to the simple
elementals.
</p>

<p>
The object of this book is not exploitation
of theories but practical service to writers and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
would-be writers.  It is aimed directly at the
faults that are the chief causes of rejection of
manuscripts by magazines and book houses.
General theories are used chiefly to give
foundation and perspective, so that a writer,
knowing the general ends in view, may be
enabled to solve intelligently and consistently
even those problems in his work that can not
be covered specifically by any "book of rules."  It
is a crying need that writers should learn
to work less by rule of thumb and more from
a general understanding of what fiction
really is and of what determines its success.
For twenty years I have watched the flow of
manuscripts—more tens of thousands than I
like to remember—and am year by year more
convinced that more embryo writers of
appreciable ability are ruined by an overdose
of technique at the hands of their literary
doctors or by slavish copying of the work of
some "successful" writer than by any three
other causes you please to name.
</p>

<p>
Technique, naturally, should be a means,
not an end.  In most of the teaching of the
day so much emphasis is placed on it and
such large quantities of it are shoved down
the beginner's throat, before he has developed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
himself sufficiently to digest it instead of
merely chew it, that in a majority of cases he
loses himself and his talents in an empty
struggle with formulas and formalities.  He
may learn to chew very well indeed, but the
odds are that he isn't chewing anything and
that he has starved himself to death.  As a
matter of fact, he has ceased to be himself.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the reason for this overemphasis
on technique is that those responsible for the
books, classes and correspondence courses
designed to help the budding fiction writers
are, with very few exceptions, chiefly theorists
with no great background of either actual
editorial experience or an even fairly
considerable accomplishment in writing fiction.
Those who have both, even a moderate degree
of both, are so very few that in number
they constitute only a fraction of a per cent. of
those at work in this field.  The teachers
of fiction, a good many of them, give extremely
valuable service, but the majority of them
either approached their work from abstract
and academic beginnings or, having sold
fiction themselves, built too much from their
own experiences, knowing too little of the
many different paths by which others must
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
progress.  Both groups seem to have been too
much influenced by technique and academics
in general.
</p>

<p>
The editors, too, for the same and other
reasons, have contributed toward making
technique too great a factor.  It is physically
impossible to give individual criticism to every
manuscript that comes in, or, when given at
all, to give it fully in all cases.  Almost never
are the reasons for an acceptance given and
only in a general way at best.  As a result,
writers in their early formative stages are left
in the dark unless they turn to the other
teachers.  Much of the criticism given by
editors, too, is academic and centers on
technique—because that kind of criticism is easier
for us to give.  Still again, we often mislead
a writer by failing to distinguish carefully
between the needs and likes of the particular
magazine as opposed to those of magazines
in general.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the reasons for the exaggerated
part technique plays in American fiction, it is
the chief hope of this little book that it may
to some degree counteract this curse of
formula and encourage beginners to more direct
effort for individuality and a more natural
expression of it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
</p>

<p>
Perhaps this is not a book at all, but merely
a collection of talks.  Certainly there is little
attempt at carefully unified structure.  Its
writing must be done at odd moments, for I
am still in editorial harness.  Also it will be
done only in such moments and manner as
make the writing of it a pleasure rather than
a task.
</p>

<p>
I use the pronoun "I" without stint or
apology, for that is the natural method to
follow when one person speaks to another and,
while I object strenuously to an author's
obtrusion of himself into his fiction, the first
personal pronoun in books of exposition is
often of distinct advantage in precision as
well as in ease and clearness.
</p>

<p>
Finally, this book is not meant for geniuses.
They should by all means march their own
paths, finding or making their own methods,
each to his taste.  Though this is a book of
suggestions, not of rules, the genius does not
need it.  But wait,—alas! half my possible
readers are gone from me at the ending of
that last sentence, self-dismissed as indubitable
geniuses.  I'd forgotten that the writing
world is composed chiefly of geniuses, most
of them indubitable and—self-dismissed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
</p>

<p>
But <i>you</i>—I think you'd better read on until
you find stronger reason to turn away, for, to
be friendly frank, the odds are so very heavily
against your being a genius.  As for me, I
don't even know more than three or four
geniuses at the very most and you can be
entirely at your ease in my quite ordinary
society.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
A GENERAL SURVEY
</h3>

<p>
Let us take a general survey of what is to
follow, beginning with fundamentals.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Art Process</i>.—The art process of
fiction involves three elements—the Material,
the Artist and the Reader.  So far as my
experience and observation go, the Reader is not
regarded as a part of the art process and in
both theory and practise fails to get anything
approaching due consideration.  For that
reason his part in the art process will receive
full treatment in this book, while Material
and Artist, being already amply covered in
thousands of texts, will receive more cursory
treatment.  The reader can, nevertheless, be
made a complete basis of both rhetorical and
fictional theory.  Almost any important
element can, for that matter; it is merely a
matter of choosing the point from which you shall
look at the circle.  The reader's having been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
hitherto slighted in this respect is alone
sufficient reason to choose him if for no other
purpose than that of viewing the art process
from a new angle and thereby getting a more
balanced concept of it.  Personally, I believe
the reader's angle the correct one, being the
final step, the test of the other two.
</p>

<p>
Philosophers will at once quarrel with both
my theory and my terminology.  If they will
confine their quarreling to the field of philosophy,
they may settle the issue as they please.
Must a genius think only, or at all, of his
readers when he sits down to write?  Probably not,
but this book is not written for geniuses, who
need no rules or guidance or at least think
they do not.  Certainly either genius or plain
human will fall into ruin if he thinks
overmuch on rules and regulations of any kind
when he should be giving himself up to creating.
But I've noticed that even geniuses generally
revise their work after its first launching
in ink.  Why?
</p>

<p>
Must art be seen or heard by others before
it can be art?  Naturally I realize that the
Venus de Milo was a work of art before it was
dug up, but what of that?  It was only a
potential work of art from any practical point
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
of view and of no good to any one until
brought where material and the artist's work
on the material could continue and complete
the process by creating in human beings the
thoughts and emotions they strove to express.
In that word "express," by the way, lies the
whole divergence of theory.  Theories have
made it practically subjective only, ignoring
its objective side—the recipient.  Can you,
outside the most abstract abstractions of
philosophy, express anything without expressing
it <i>to</i> some one?  If you think you can, how
are you going to be sure that you have
expressed it?  Who is to be the judge on this
point?  You, the artist, alone?  Perhaps the
philosophers can show me my position is
untenable, but they can't show me one single
fiction editor in all the world who wouldn't
throw up his hands in despair at the very
idea of letting every "artist" be the judge as
to whether he had expressed what he thought
he had expressed.  Even non-editors, who
haven't been tortured by the mistaken idea of
"artists" that they have succeeded in
expression, would be more than slow to admit the
artists themselves as competent judges or to
abide by the artists' judgments.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
</p>

<p>
Consigning abstraction to the background,
you are a fool if you put into material what
no one else can get out of it.  And I'd say
that you were not a genius, the two terms not
being mutually exclusive, for a genius—at
least all whom the world has been able to
discover—does not fail to convey his message
to at least a few.
</p>

<p>
To how many people and to what grades of
intelligence must the artist convey his
message in order to prove himself an artist?  I do
not know.  Neither, I think, does anybody
else.  There seems almost equal disagreement
as to the character and quality of the
message to be conveyed.  But I can see no doubt
that some message must be conveyed to somebody
and it would seem that the greater and
better the message and the more the recipients,
the more successful is the work of art.
</p>

<p>
On the practical basis that the would-be
fictionist wishes to sell his fiction to the
magazine or book houses, it follows naturally that
as a first step his success will be measured by
the number of people to whom he is able to
convey his message, the thought and feeling
he desires to express.  After reaching them,
it of course becomes a question of the quality
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
of his message, but that quality can be known
only by those readers reached by it.  It
becomes a question, also, of the degree to which
he reaches them.
</p>

<p>
But first, and most of all, he must reach
them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Clearness</i>.—It follows that the prime essential
is clearness.  If they are to get his message
at all, they must be able to understand
what he says.  If they are to get it fully, he
must express exactly what he means and do
so in such manner that they will understand
it exactly as he means it.  This may seem too
elementary for consideration.  It isn't.  The
theory is readily admitted but not sufficiently
practised.  The guiltiest are often the most
unconscious of their guilt, for it is a common
serious failing of writers to believe that
because they have made things plain to
themselves they have made them plain to others.
</p>

<p>
Clearness is not merely a question of
unambiguous sentences, though the majority of
writers do not successfully mount even that
simple hurdle.  Clearness includes supplying
all necessary details, suppressing the unnecessary
ones, giving to each the proportionate
emphasis you wish the reader to give to it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
and seeing to it that his response is exact, and
so shaping your presentation of the story that
the reader <i>must</i> follow the exact path you
have mapped out for him.
</p>

<p>
<i>Other Essentials</i>.—A valuable accessory in
attaining clearness is simplicity.  But most
writers abhor simplicity, apparently because
being simple seems to them to ruin their
chance of being "literary."
</p>

<p>
Clearness, simplicity, force, but the last two
of this old triology of the rhetorics are really
included under clearness in its full meaning.
So, too, perhaps, are unity and structure.  In
any case, all are necessary in getting the
writer's message to his readers.
</p>

<p>
Shall I sound hopelessly elementary and
banal when I say that, to register his message
in full force, the author must enlist his
reader's sympathies?  Yet the majority of those
who attempt fiction either give this necessity
no thought or are unbelievably crude and
stupid, not only missing chance after chance
to secure this sympathy, but continually and
needlessly alienating it.  I do not use
"sympathy" in its sugary sense, but shall attempt
no exact definition in this chapter of
preliminary survey.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
</p>

<p>
As essentials for the securing of the
reader's sympathies may be included unity and
structure—in some of their phases more
properly included here than under clearness.
</p>

<p>
Also, he must economize his reader—carefully
regulate demands on attention, thought
and feelings according to a human being's
normal ability to respond as well as according
to the varying needs of different parts of
the tale.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Illusion</i>.—Lastly, to convey his
message fully, he must <i>impose and preserve the
illusion of his story</i>.  In this are really
included all the necessities named, even clearness.
And, I think, all necessities that can be
named.  This, it may be said, <i>is</i> fiction—the
imposing and preserving of an illusion.  I
make it the basis of this book because it offers
what seems at present the angle of approach
most needed in teaching the successful writing
of stories, in correcting the faults most
common and most fatal, and in providing
writers with a consistent and comprehensive
theory that they can apply to their needs and
problems as these arise.
</p>

<p>
Itself a return to the solid foundation of
underlying elementals, it has the very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
practical merit of compelling writers to make the
elementals the constant test of their work.
Necessarily involving a constant and careful
consideration of the reader, it seems the best
remedy for the greatest weakness in fiction
writing—the tendency to limit the art process
to the second of its three steps, Material,
Artist and Reader.  If the third step can be
helped to its due share of attention, the first
step can wait its turn, at least so far as the
successful writing of magazine and ordinary
book fiction is concerned.
</p>

<p>
Do I then mean that the prime object of
fiction is the imposing of an illusion?  That
here lies the test of fiction?  That no fiction
is written or read or valued except for its
success in creating an illusion?  The imposing of
an illusion is the object and test of fiction <i>as
fiction</i>.  Fiction serves many purposes.  It
may teach something, show something, what
you please.  But for these things it is only a
vehicle, and the test of it <i>as a vehicle</i> lies in
its success at imposing an illusion.
</p>

<p>
As to whether my theory of fiction is "new"
and "revolutionary" I can offer only that it
was new to my experience and revolutionary
only in that, in the actual editorial work of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
helping writers develop their abilities for
fiction, it has seemed to effect results that no
other theory was able to effect.  I might add,
also, that the fiction department of a Coast
University, having come across some of my
correspondence with contributors, wrote me
that the fully developed principle of preserving
the illusion had not, to their knowledge,
been elsewhere advanced, that they had
adopted it as a regular part of their course,
and that it had satisfactorily stood the test of
several years.  On the other hand I have
learned, even since the actual writing of this
book was begun, that for several years Doctor
Dorothy Scarborough has taught this principle
to her classes in short-story writing in
Columbia University.
</p>

<p>
As to the newness of dividing the art process
into the three steps of Material, Artist,
Reader, I can not say.  So far as I know, it is
my own idea, the joining together of two lines
of thought on which I had been working.  On
the other hand, I should be amazed if others
had not previously advanced the same theory.
</p>

<p>
<i>Literature vs. Magazine Fiction</i>.—What
distinction do I make between literature and
magazine fiction?  In fundamentals, none.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
Only a small percentage of magazine fiction
is literature in the distinctive sense of that
term.  That so little of it is literature is partly
due to the arbitrary and entirely non-literary
restrictions imposed by the magazines with
their various aims as to types of audience.
Some will not accept unhappy endings, some
bar sex questions, some use no stories of
foreign lands, some demand action, some permit
no mention of drink or tobacco, some will
have no "problems," some require a breezy,
sophisticated style, some must have this, some
abhor that.  Most writers must sell what they
write or stop writing through lack of means
or lack of tenacity.  Naturally they generally
strive to make their goods acceptable to the
market, writing with a careful eye on the likes
and dislikes of the magazines and all the
more harassed and limited because what is
one magazine's meat is another magazine's
poison.
</p>

<p>
Some, like Sinclair Lewis, Talbot Mundy
and others, fully realizing the situation and
keeping their heads, write what they know
will sell, write it as well as they can under the
limitations, and keep on writing it until they
have attained sufficient standing and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
financial foundation—and sufficient mastery—to
write what they wish and in the way they
wish.  But the vast majority become permanent
slaves in the galley where they must serve
their apprenticeship, perhaps growing very
skilful in handling one oar among the many
oars but hopelessly unable to paddle their
own canoe.
</p>

<p>
If money success is essential or preferred,
by all means draw a sharp distinction
between literature and magazine fiction and,
unless you are quite sure your talents are
considerable, confine yourself to the latter.
On the other hand, granted sufficient ability,
aiming at the former may very well carry you
further in every way.  If what you wish is,
regardless of worldly success, to write the
best that in you lies, forget everything else,
including the restrictions of the magazines.
</p>

<p>
Another cause of the scarcity of literature
in magazine fiction is that writers, editors
and readers become obsessed with fads,
generally of a superficial nature, as to style, or
treatment, or types of material.  Underneath
this is a more fundamental cause—the habit
of imitation.  O. Henry wrote and died and
even yet the mails are full of manuscripts
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
from writers who are trying to write O. Henry
stories—and can't, for the simple and
everlasting reason that no one of them is
O. Henry.  Every John Smith of them would do
better work if he wrote John Smith stories,
but lots of them are still selling O. Henry
stories because editors too are still under the
O. Henry spell or know that many of their
readers are.  Kipling, Doyle, James and other
famous authors have each their army of
imitators, many a sheep-like soldier serving in
several armies at once.
</p>

<p>
Nor do the imitators always aim so nigh.
Any writer popular in the magazines, no
matter how ephemeral his vogue, serves them
almost equally well.  The lowest depths are
reached when the model is no one in
particular but merely a composite of all that is
most hack and usual on the printed page.
</p>

<p>
Not long ago there arose again the fad of
beginning a story with a paragraph of
philosophy.  It has spread like a disease and, I
think, is one.  There were—or are—the era
of glittering sophistication in style, the <i>Dolly
Dialogues</i> and <i>Prisoner of Zenda</i> eras,
doublet and hose, business, sex, Stevensonian
rhythm, and so on.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
</p>

<p>
But all these fads and other limitations
serve only to lower the proportion of literature
in magazine fiction.  Neither they nor
anything else creates any fundamental difference
between the two.  Both are fiction, both
subject to the laws of fiction.  And even that
magazine fiction beyond the pale of literature
is aimed, somehow, at the reader and is
to be judged on that basis.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
CREATING THE ILLUSION
</h3>

<p>
By creating the illusion I mean making the
reader forget the world he really lives in and
carrying him into the world of the story,
either identifying himself with one of the
characters or looking on and listening
entirely absorbed in what he sees and hears.
The illusion is wholly successful, fully
effective, only if the reader is made to live
altogether in the story world.  He must forget
that he is a reader, that he holds a book or
magazine in his hands, that the story is
merely a story instead of actual happening.
He must forget that there is such a thing as
an author; he must forget the method and
manner of telling in the telling itself.  He
must <i>live</i> the story.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Illusion and Its Hold</i>.—Naturally
perfection of illusion is not generally attained,
and naturally what holds some readers in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
thrall may not hold others.  The more
sophisticated the reader, the more difficult, other
things being equal, to make him lose himself
utterly in the story.  Probably, too, the more
fiction one has read, the less readily is one
swept away into the story's spell.  The same
obstructions hold in any art, or in eating or
any other pleasure.  The penalty of sophistication
in anything is further removal from
the direct, elemental appeal.  The penalty of
satiety and overuse is a dulling of response.
But these facts do not alter the matter of
what the appeal is.
</p>

<p>
But do not the sophisticated get more out
of fiction—out of the "highbrow" fiction they
tend toward—than do the unsophisticated
out of the same fiction?  Get more what?
More of the finer shadings undoubtedly, but
less of the elemental appeal.  And is it really
fiction they are reading or something else
mixed with fiction, and is it from fiction or
other things they draw pleasure or edification?
Their attitude is at least partly that of
a critic rather than a recipient; their interest
in "What is happening" is at least partly
distracted to "how it is written."  From fiction
itself, from fiction as fiction, the unsophisticated,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
granting them understanding of the
words they read, in most cases get a greater
intensity of appeal than do the others.
Understand, I am speaking not of general
sophistication but of sophistication in fiction.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fiction a Vehicle</i>.—As you run over in your
mind various writers of acknowledged rank
you may feel that, in face of that rank,
illusion is an unsound basis of test and
comparison.  The stumbling-block is that much of
what we call fiction is not pure fiction but a
hybrid, a cross, a half-breed or even a
quadroon—fiction plus an essay, treatise, study,
sermon, analysis, philosophy, satire,
propaganda, a performance in technique, an
exhibition of style, what you will.  It is often the
other element or elements, or the combination
of elements, that appeals and that gives
rank and value.  There is no reason why
writings should not be read and written for
the sake of these other elements or of the
combinations, but such writings are not pure
fiction.
</p>

<p>
In such cases fiction is used not for itself
alone but as a vehicle for something else.
The wagon and its load may be more pleasing
and valuable than the wagon alone, but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
only the wagon is fiction and therefore it is
with the wagon alone that we are now
concerned.  No matter how good the load may
be, you can not carry it unless you can build
and drive a good wagon.  Probably the
majority of writers will profit most by giving
their whole attention to the wagon, partly
because they haven't a sufficiently valuable
load to put in it and partly because they need
their undivided effort to make the wagon fit
to carry anything.  Certainly it is sound for
ninety-odd per cent. of fiction writers to
master their vehicle before they attempt hauling
messages and information in it.
</p>

<p>
This book deals with straight fiction only.
Straight fiction may of course include analysis,
philosophy, technique, information and
all the other things for which it is so often
made the vehicle, but if it is to remain straight
fiction, these must be really integral and
necessary parts of it—analysis of or by the
characters themselves, the information
inherent in the material, the technique necessary
for presentation, the philosophy of a character,
locality or nation.  Having sufficiently
mastered straight fiction, a writer is infinitely
more likely to be successful in registering on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
his readers whatever it is he may wish to
convey through fiction as a vehicle.  His
message may be so interesting or important that
people will seize upon it eagerly, no matter
how crude or weak the fiction-vehicle may
be, but it would reach them all the more
strongly if the vehicle were a competent
carrier.
</p>

<p>
<i>Illusion the Essence of Fiction</i>.—The very
essence of straight fiction is the creation and
maintenance of an illusion.  That this truth
has been so largely lost sight of is due largely
to the frequent mixture of fiction with other
things, so that the mixture, instead of fiction
itself, has tended to become the model and
standard.  If American writers are to make
more rapid progress toward real success, they
would do well to segregate fiction and study
it for itself alone.
</p>

<p>
<i>Illusion Easily Shattered</i>.—Successful
illusion depends on an infinite variety of things,
is as sensitive to breakage as is a bubble and,
once broken, though it can be again created,
its strength is irremediably impaired.  A
writer of any merit can impose his illusion,
yet often he does so apparently through
instinct only, without evidence of carefully
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
considered knowledge and intent.  Certainly it is
maddeningly common to see him again and
again destroy his illusion, if only temporarily,
with some "little" flaw that would almost
unconsciously be avoided if he had clear
conception of the fundamental importance of
perfect and uninterrupted illusion.
</p>

<p>
The importance of maintenance of illusion
can not be too much stressed.  As a reader can
you keep yourself within the spell of a story
you are reading if you are subject to constant
physical interruptions—conversation directed
at you, people coming in and going out, loud
and sudden noises?  No more can a reader
keep himself within the spell of a story if he
is subject to constant interruptions from within
the story itself.  How can a story maintain
its spell over you if you are again and again
reminded by its text that it is, after all, only
a story, somebody's words typed on the pages
of a magazine you bought at the corner stand?
</p>

<p>
<i>Costliness of Breaking the Illusion</i>.—Each
such interruption or reminder does its share
in wrecking the illusion, each compels the
story to begin over again in the business of
making you forget your world in its world,
each leaves the remainder of the illusion the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
weaker.  Even a single one in a story works
very appreciable damage to the illusion as a
whole, lessens the net result of the story's
impact upon readers.  Instead of the story's
registering one hundred per cent. of its value,
it is, as a result of a single break in its illusion,
likely to register, not ninety-eight or ninety-five
per cent., but eighty-five or seventy or
sixty per cent.  There can, of course, be no
exact measure of the loss in the story's
effectiveness, of the amount of failure in the third
step of the art process, but very surely this
loss is almost universally underestimated or
altogether ignored.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the value of your story as fiction,
you can not afford to have its one hundred
per cent. reduced even five per cent. in
its register upon your reader, and the instant
you remind him that he is still merely himself
in his same old world—or, even worse, make
him momentarily a critic instead of a
reader—you seriously damage the illusion and
lessen your story's effect.  The break may
occupy only a fraction of a second's time, the
reader, after a few paragraphs may forget all
about the break, may even be wholly unconscious
at the time of its effect upon him, but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
the harm has been done nevertheless.  It can
be no comfort to the writer that the reader
doesn't know why the story failed to register
its full strength; the important point is that it
did fail.
</p>

<p>
Some breaks in the illusion accomplish
even more harm than letting the reader escape
from the story's spell, since it is always
so easily possible to lose a reader's sympathies
or, worse, let him fall into a critical
attitude, or, worst of all, cause him irritation
or arouse his hostility.  If, in reaching the
reader, a story loses part of its value by
merely letting him get from under its spell,
the loss is still greater if it loses his
sympathies, for even when he is again brought
under its spell he can not possibly be so
wholly given over to it as he was before.  If
you have made of him a critic—well, how
much sympathy has a critic?  If you have
irritated him, naturally your chances of
pleasing him are sadly diminished, since you
must overcome a heavy handicap before you
can even begin to do so.  And if you have
made him your enemy, you may as well bid
farewell to any chance of your story's success.
No matter how good the first two steps
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
of that story's art process—Material,
Writer—if the third step—Reader—can not be
taken, then nothing has been completed
except an unrealized potentiality.
</p>

<p>
<i>Need of Emphasizing the Illusion</i>.—And
yet, when it comes to the actual writing of
fiction these practical, common-sense, vital
facts are unrecognized or forgotten to an
almost unbelievable degree.  Day after day
the magazine offices are rejecting manuscripts
that would have been accepted but for
the failure of illusion.  Generally the editor
calls it "unconvincingness."  Year after year
class-room and text-book go on teaching plot,
style, characterization that go for naught if
they are unable to register upon the reader.
Year after year writers, oppressed with rules
and abstractions, laboriously build pieces of
machinery and expect readers to take these
obvious, clanking collections of bolts, girders,
wheels and cogs for something that is alive.
Why not?  They've been taught to consider
only the making of a perfect machine according
to formula.  They find the magazines
heavily laden with machines and are the more
convinced that machinery is the ultimate
attainment.  Little teaching do they get that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
helps them put the breath of life into their
stories or gives them the habit of seeing also
from the reader's point of view!  They "try it
on their friends"—God save the mark!—their
friends respond or pretend to and the problem
of the reader, if it arose at all, is
satisfactorily settled for all time.
</p>

<p>
But mustn't they be taught plot, etc.?  Of
course.  But plot, etc., are merely tools.  A
man may be passing skilful in the handling
of chisel and mallet yet fail dismally as a
sculptor.  Plot, etc., are necessary, but they
must be taught, not as abstractions, but as
reasoned and reasonable outgrowths of
something more vital than they.
</p>

<p>
<i>Individuality Crushed by Rules</i>.—Some
writers escape from the net or are too big to
be caught in it.  These are in a painful
minority.  The tragedy is in the host of those who
had sufficient talent and individuality for a
moderate success but never attain it because
their talent is diverted to formulas and their
individuality crushed by academics.
</p>

<p>
Those who escape do so generally through
either disgust or despair.  They sweep the
rules away or turn their backs upon them
and—go ahead on their own.  One advantage
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
gained thereby is instant, inevitable,
automatic, for they have made an all-important
step forward—being no longer ridden and
haunted by formulas and rules, the writer at
last has <i>a chance to live the illusion of his
own story</i> and therefore a far better chance
of making the reader live it.
</p>

<p>
The following is part of a letter from a
writer who appears in <i>The Saturday Evening
Post, McClure's</i> and other magazines of that
grade.  Years ago he used to send me well-made
but colorless and formal stories.  During
some of the years between he had done
no writing.  Then he sent me one of the new
kind.  Amazed at the remarkable improvement
in his work, I asked him what had happened.
In his reply the omitted name is that
of a magazine:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
In those days I was rigidly following the
rules of what I call the —— school of the
American short story.
</p>

<p class="quote">
—— stories and the stories of the school
which it dominated, were all like Fords.  They
were of limited horsepower, neat, trim and
shiny, taking up very little road space,
structurally correct and all following the
blueprint without the slightest deviation.  There
weren't any big powerful Cadillacs zipping
along, or any dirty, greasy trucks hauling
huge burdens and disturbing and upsetting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
the normal run of things.  It was an endless
highway just jammed with Fords.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The —— story, from a standpoint of
construction, was astonishingly well done.  It
had a beginning, a middle and an end, but
few intestines anywhere along the route.  The
workmanship was wonderful.  It was
astonishing how many people there were who
could write such beautiful English.  There
was one punch, one climax, which was very
carefully led up to, and that was all.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Well, I tried to follow the rules as
apparently laid down.  I agonized over each word
and sentence to get 'em just exactly <i>right</i>.  I
have sat at my typewriter for an hour to get
just the few syllables that their standards
seemed to demand.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The Hades of it was that the reader was being
cheated all the time.  He got a lot of very
fine writing, but not much story.  It was like
sitting down to a dinner where the appointments
were perfect, the water clear and ice-cold,
the napery thick, the glassware thin,
flowers on the table, an orchestra, perfect
service, and not enough food for a canary-bird.
In other words, a race of bird-shot
stylists was being propagated who could write
beautifully about an ant-hill but hadn't the
equipment to do anything for a mountain.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I trailed along because I didn't know any
better and because I hadn't been waked up
and shaken down.  I had lived, but I had not
assimilated and correlated my experiences.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Now his present method, and if your nose
is inclined to turn up at his idea of style,
before you let it, make very sure that he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
hasn't taken the one sure road to the only
kind of style worth any one's having.  And
note carefully what he says about the outside
of the motor-car:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
I try to give the reader a lot for his money.
I don't try to do any fine writing.  Only one
of a million of us can be a polished stylist.
I'm not that one, but I think I can evolve a
story and tell it.  So there is no more agonizing
about the style.  I try not to make the outside
of the motor-car which bears my people
all gold and shiny and flower-decked so that
the countryside will look at the car, and not
at those it contains.  I just try to make it a
good, suitable, unobtrusive vehicle which will
start and get to the journey's end without any
tire trouble or backfires.  I try to imagine
real people—very often they are friends and
acquaintances whose mental reactions I have
noted under circumstances similar to those
described in the yarn.  And I try to visualize
every important scene before I set it down.
That is, I shut my eyes and see the people as
though I were looking at a scene from a play.
</p>

<p class="quote">
And it's just a joy, under those conditions,
to write.  To go to my machine with the keenest
anticipation.  It is the finest sort of an
adventure to translate a good story and send
it on its way.  I write much more easily and
I think less artificially than in those days of
deadly correctness—and dullness.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There are thousands of other cases—proved,
not yet proved or never to be proved—of
writers whose individuality has been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
crushed out or whose success has been
prevented or delayed by the present academic
and unhuman methods of teaching the writing
of fiction, by forgetting the illusion and
the reader for the sake of the <i>means</i> of
securing them.  Here is an example so extreme
that it must in fairness to other teachers of
fiction be labeled as the last word in formula.
It is, nevertheless, only the usual method
fully and relentlessly developed.  It is taken
word for word from the teacher's printed
statement of his "mathematical rule" for
plot:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
If the thread A, or viewpoint character,
figures with the thread B in an opening incident
of numerical order "n" there must follow
rapidly after the opening of the story an
incident n-plus-1 involving threads A and C, an
incident n-plus-2 involving threads A and D,
an incident n-plus-3 involving threads A and
E, and so on, up to perhaps at least n-plus-4
or n-plus-5; and furthermore, n must
produce n-plus-1, n-plus-2 must be the result of
n-plus-1, n-plus-3 must be the result of
n-plus-2, and so on.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
That formula is, I dare say, sound and, if
sound, undoubtedly useful.  The teacher sells
his own stories regularly to magazines and,
as he is an apparently successful teacher,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
probably numerous pupils of his are doing
the same.  (It is stated that his output for the
last five years was about one million words,
with sales of about ninety-six per cent.)  Yet
I think you will agree that his formula leaves
something to be desired.
</p>

<p>
If I have talked overlong of Reader and
Illusion in their general aspect it is because I
have found that, while some writers grasp the
idea at once, a minority seem incapable of
seeing any possibility of difference between
what a writer intends the reader to get and
what the reader really does get, incapable of
believing that they have not expressed in full
and with perfect exactness all that they saw
and know and felt when writing, and incapable
of conceiving any reader who would not
be spell-bound by their stories and in full
sympathy with every shading and inflection
whether real, imagined or flatly reversed in
expression.
</p>

<p>
The interrupters and destroyers of illusion
are almost infinite in variety and number.
The means of avoiding them, indeed, constitute
a complete set of working rules for the
writing of fiction—better still, a basis from
which a writer can draw his own rules to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
meet all occasions as they arise.  They may
be very roughly divided into classes, the
small, cruder interruptions that are comparatively
detached and temporary and the more
fundamental, organic and permanent ones.
Most of the latter being treated, though from
a different point of view, by the usual textbook,
the smaller ones are in greater need of
consideration and will be taken up first.
</p>

<p>
It is understood, however, that definite
classification is not attempted and that the
division into sub-groups is for convenience only.
An item in one group may belong equally in
several others and will often be treated under
more than one.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
YOUR READERS
</h3>

<p>
Readers of course vary in susceptibility to
the illusion of fiction—vary in concentration,
reading method, background of culture and
of experience in life, familiarity with the
ways and habits of fiction, critical attitude,
imagination, particularly strength and quality
of imaginative imagery, and in everything
else that makes up mentality and individuality.
Must the writer satisfy and hold all
these from one extreme to the other?  Yes, if
he is to do perfect fiction.  Possibly perfect
fiction exists, but fortunately readers can be
more or less divided into classes or types,
each class capable of being very roughly
characterized as a unit.  The more classes
reached and satisfied by a story, the better
the story.
</p>

<p>
<i>Be Clear as to Your Audience</i>.—The fiction
author can follow one of three courses:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
</p>

<p>
(1) He can "just write," disregarding the
question of who his readers may be and
trusting that his style and methods may happen
to be such as will win him an audience.  This
is an admirable method provided it chances
to succeed.  If it doesn't, he will have to
abandon it for one of the others.
</p>

<p>
(2) Choose a particular class for his
audience and aim directly at them.  Naturally
he will have to study his audience very
carefully and know them rather thoroughly
if he is to succeed.  Limiting his audience,
he limits the scope and therefore the degree
of his success; a story satisfying the highest
class can not be so good as if it satisfied both
the highest and the next highest class or several
other classes.  It is entirely possible to
do both, as Shakespeare and others have
proved.
</p>

<p>
(3) Aim to reach as many classes as possible.
Here, too, he must study and know his
audience.  Obviously it is a higher aim than
the second, demanding more of the author.
Having a larger audience to draw on, it is
likely to attain greater success as measured
by number of readers, though it is always a
nice problem to decide in a given case
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
whether more readers can be secured by
playing for your share of the majority,
against all competitors, or by concentrating
on a minority, against fewer competitors.
</p>

<p>
Considering carefully these three courses,
it is necessary first to know your audience
and keep them very definitely in mind,
unless you are willing to write wholly from
the subjective point of view and go it blind
as to your audience, taking the extremely
long chance that your substance and style
may happen to satisfy a sufficient number of
readers.  It generally doesn't.  Second, it is
advisable to reach as many classes of readers
as possible.  Your task, then, is to know and
to consider constantly as many classes of
readers as you can.  And knowing them
means much more than having a general
knowledge of their tastes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fundamental Reactions Universal</i>.—Some
will straightway object, "But I prefer to write
for only the highest class of readers."  It is
their right to do so, and their choice may be
a wise one.  But I maintain two points.  First,
it is not the highest aim.  Second, the writer
who prefers this aim is probably most likely
of all to fail to know his audience.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
mistake to which he is peculiarly liable is that
of forgetting that the highest class is not a
thing apart but merely all the other classes
plus something more.  His tendency is to
believe that they have passed on beyond all the
tastes and reactions of the other classes far
more than they really have.  Most of all, he
is likely to credit them with having risen
above the cruder, more fundamental tastes
and reactions of the other classes.  They
haven't.  They have merely piled upon the
fundamental reactions a larger collection of
refined—and often artificial—reactions than
have the others.  The fundamental reactions
may become somewhat blurred and aborted,
are certainly less consciously active and
generally less active in fact, but they are still
there and still operative and sometimes in full
strength.  That is as true as any general rule
that can be laid down concerning the human
mind and too much emphasis can not be
placed on it.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Target</i>.—To reach any audience
perfectly you must reach them at all points,
satisfying all demands, overcoming all their
inherent obstacles, allowing for the varying
equipment ranging from the lowest to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
highest among them—equipment of background,
imagination, concentration, general
intelligence and so on.  And on each point
you must reach those most gifted in it, most
difficult to satisfy in that respect.  It is not
enough to satisfy those with little cultural
background; your story must stand the test
of those who have the most.  It must reach
not only those who set particular store by the
delicate shadings, but those who demand a
definite story interest.  On any point you
must aim to reach the individuals who are
most difficult to reach on that point.  In no
other way can you hope to reach all.
</p>

<p>
It is not easy to do.  In fact, it isn't done.
But it must be the target aimed at.  It is not
easy to reach both the person who reads
word for word, extracting the full flavor of
each, and also the person who skips
sentences, paragraphs and pages in mad pursuit
of "what happens"; nor him who at a word
or two from you reconstructs a whole scene
in his mind's eye, and him whose imagination
can vision for him only what you describe in
detail.  Yet, if you are to attain the degree of
success possible to you, you must aim to
satisfy in each such dilemma the extreme that
for you is most difficult.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Study Human Beings</i>.—First, last and all
the time, success means study of the reader.
That means study of human beings, not merely
of opinions of them or of effects secured or
apparently secured on them by other writers.
The opinions may be mistaken; the effects
may be there, but you and the other writers
may fail to assign to them the proper causes.
Strangely enough, the causes most often
overlooked are the elemental tastes and reactions
common to all normal humans.  It is more
"literary," and more convenient, to study lists
of "best sellers," to read critical reviews and
academic essays, to be given rules and standards
by some one else—who got them from
reviews, essays and "best sellers."  But it is
human beings who are your readers.  Get
your data at first hand.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
DISTRACTIONS
</h3>

<p>
To hold a reader in the illusion of a story
it is of course necessary to hold his attention,
not merely in a general way, but entirely and
without break, interruption or hindrance.
He must live wholly and every instant in the
story world—must never be recalled for even
the fraction of a second to the real world he
lives in.
</p>

<p>
In writing any story there are a thousand
chances of breaking the illusion by some
little touch.  Most of these are almost
automatically avoided even by writers of small
ability.  Otherwise there would be no fiction.
The point is that what are usually a very
small minority are not avoided by most writers.
The result is that editors are likely to
reject the story because it does not "hold the
interest," is not "convincing" or "lacks
punch."  Their finding is probably just,
though they may not have analyzed for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
causes, and the writer is not enlightened or
even convinced of the finding.
</p>

<p>
<i>Disproportionate Damage from
Distractions</i>.—Failing to avoid even an extreme
minority of the chances for breaking the
illusion is enough to injure the story very
seriously.  You can't afford to let your reader
escape from the story's spell, slip back into
the world he really lives in, even momentarily.
For you have to waste at least a little of
the story's potential force in getting him back
again, which means that you can never get
him back <i>quite</i> so fully as you had him
before.  You may even not get him back at all.
You can't afford to have him become even
momentarily a critic, for you must waste at
least a little of the story's potential appeal in
order to change him back from the critical
attitude to sympathy and absorption.  You
can't afford to let his attention wander off to
side-issues, for the story has to stop working
at being a story in order to get him back on
the main line and it needs every atom of its
strength for the main job.
</p>

<p>
We recently published one of the best
stories <i>Adventure</i> ever printed, a combination
of simple narrative appeal and of literary
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
excellence of the first water.  It is bringing
us many letters of appreciation.  To-day I
read a long letter from one reader who had
found in that story nothing, either good or
bad, except that there was an indirect
inconsistency as to one character's exact age.  That
was what you might call the <i>net result</i> of that
story on a reader.  All the strength and merit
of an otherwise splendid story completely
wrecked for a reader by that one trifling
point!  Undoubtedly others detected the same
inconsistency but suffered less acutely or did
not register their "kick."  But in each case
the appeal of the story lost strength out of
all proportion to the size of the detail
involved.
</p>

<p>
It is a typical, not an exceptional, case,
except for the unusual merit of the story ruined.
Thousands of letters like that come in from
readers, often many on the same tiny slip or
discrepancy.  To those readers the story in
question left as its chief impress upon them a
violence—at one tiny point—to their knowledge
of fact or sense of consistency.  In each
case how many other such readers are there
who do not write us?
</p>

<p>
Other thousands of readers protest over
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
such slips, such distractions from the illusion,
but are not so completely swamped by them
that they fail to consider the merits of the
story as a whole.  But, even with them, how
big looms the tiny flaw in proportion to the
whole!  In each case how many other such
readers are there who do not write in?
</p>

<p>
<i>How to Use Your Friends</i>.—No point that
may distract a reader can be so small that it
is not serious.  You can not measure the harm
done; in one case there may be no harm, in
another a little, in another a great deal.  But
if writers who have their friends "criticize"
their stories would ask these friends to give
less attention to "literary" points and take
careful note of every little thing that in any
way attracted attention to itself or sent the
mind wandering off to things outside the
story, they would get some invaluable
pointers—of the only kind that the usual friend is
really capable of giving.  If some day the
colleges make systematic laboratory tests along
these lines they should get data as surprising
as they would be useful.
</p>

<p>
<i>Unusual Words</i>.—Consider how tiny a
thing is capable of pricking the bubble of
illusion, of jerking the reader for a brief
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
instant back into his real world so that he
must be drawn again into the fiction spell.
If in reading a story you come upon some
such word as "pringle," "anodic," "calipash,"
"mansuetude," "spiracle," "frigorific,"
"cambist," "gibbous," "ortelic" you probably find
it unfamiliar and, if so, of course know that
you do.  Therein lies the breaking of the
illusion.  However brief the total time
occupied by your reaction to the word, however
slightly you may seem to have paused over
it, you <i>paused</i> and you paused over <i>it</i>—gave
attention to <i>it</i>, not to the story.  You had to
<i>remember yourself</i>, your own knowledge
and experience.  Quite possibly you also
considered the author's contrasting knowledge
and experience, and the author is not
the story.  Possibly you tried to figure out
the meaning of the word from its derivation
or the context, or dredged your own memory
for it, making your pause over it still
longer.  Perhaps your pause totaled only a
few seconds or a fraction of one second,
but—the illusion was broken and had to be
rebuilt.
</p>

<p>
Far less unusual words than those cited
will be unfamiliar to part of most audiences.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
</p>

<p>
Would one such word do very serious damage?
Very unlikely.  But it would do some,
and even a small damage is to be avoided if
possible.  Would four such words?  There
can of course be no definite measurement,
but one thing is sure—<i>four would do far more
than four times as much damage as one</i>.  The
effects are cumulative, following a kind of
geometrical progression.  And no one knows
when a serious breaking-point may be
reached.
</p>

<p>
Is a writer never to use a "big word"?  Not
if it's too big for his audience.  In the mouth
of a character he may put any word he
pleases, provided it is used for sound
purposes of characterization or for some other
specific demand of the story itself, but not for
the mere telling of the story.  He might, for
example, wish to impress a learned or
scientific atmosphere.  In this case, too, there
is the saving fact that the reader need not
know the meaning of these words, and knows
that he need not, just as he would know he
need not if he were actually living in the
scene.  He does not feel challenged by them.
"Big words" may be justified in scores of
typical instances, but there is no instance in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
which it does not pay to consider whether the
damage may not outweigh the gain.
</p>

<p>
Even an unusual word whose meaning is at
once apparent to any one, like "cat-silent,"
should be carefully weighed as to advantages
<i>vs.</i> disadvantages before it is used.  And only
in the rarest instances can there be justification
for using such a word more than once in
the same story, lest the recurrence added to
the unusualness make a double distraction.
</p>

<p>
<i>Foreign Words</i>.—The same applies to
words from foreign languages.  Undoubtedly
they are valuable in giving color, but this
value is too often attained at too high cost in
distraction and is frequently attainable
through other means without loss.  The damage
they do is by no means theoretical, for
readers do not hesitate to complain to editors
on this score.  I do not remember their doing
so in the case of "big words," for naturally a
man doesn't go to the trouble to admit he
doesn't understand words in his own language,
while often rather proud of not understanding
foreign words.  Sufficient color
through foreign words can be gained by using
only a few, even if these few are repeated,
and by using only those instantly clear from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
the context or from unmistakable similarity
to the corresponding English word (like
"<i>fader</i>") if context heads the reader in that
general direction.  There is comparatively
only a slight risk in using those that are very
generally known, like "<i>ami</i>" or "<i>mon chère</i>"
also ejaculations that are evidently such and
therefore make no demand on the reader's
understanding.
</p>

<p>
<i>Classical, Historical and Fictional
References</i>.—The danger, of course, is that the
reader may not be familiar with the reference,
knows that he is not, and therefore
becomes conscious of himself as a reader.
Another risk is that, being familiar with
them, his mind drifts off to them more
than the writer intended.  Used with discretion,
they may have value, but they are generally
not used with discretion and, generally
speaking, a story is the better for telling itself
without covering part of the ground by means
of what are practically quotations from other
stories.  Also, there are other dangers than
that of simple distraction, which will be
covered under other heads.
</p>

<p>
<i>Unusual Proper Names</i>.—To put this case
concretely, here is the list of the male
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
characters in one single story I read yesterday in a
manuscript: "Tom Goit," "Braith,"
"Grahame," "Tim Stine," "Linus Kime,"
"Jestock," "Bissonet," "Heads," "Arnet,"
"Jimson," "Kliedjorn," "Jed Willoughby," "Andy
Meenal," "Yard Sant," "Simson," "Angus
Stell," "Gant," "Beezaw," "Colin Corbin,"
"Happy Falls," "Jim Light," "Rafe Gillen,"
"Charley Jance."  It is probably not entirely
complete, but was made by running through
the pages and taking all names noted, usual
or unusual.  Can any human being read that
story without having his attention distracted
to the fact that those names are violently
unusual?  Doesn't the fact that they are unusual
add an air of unreality to the whole
story—story-book names instead of real people's
names?  Won't many readers be definitely
irritated by the artificiality and mannerism?
Aside from this and similar breakings of
illusion it was a good story and will undoubtedly
be printed somewhere.  Its author is a
successful writer of fiction.  But hasn't the
story lost very appreciably through that
amazing collection of proper names?
</p>

<p>
On the other hand there is a certain advantage
in the use of such names in some types
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
of story and for some audiences, though not
in the story from which the above are taken
or for the audience at which it is aimed.
Some readers like proper names that are
baldly fictional and unreal; that is what
fiction means to them—unreality, utter
difference from their own lives.  These are much
the same readers who like their stories filled
with duchesses, earls and ancestral halls.  A
generation or two ago these were a rather
large group, and larger still before that, but
nowadays folks are more sophisticated in
their fiction and need illusions that run more
nearly with reality.  And, at best, isn't it
rather a cheap method of abnormality?
</p>

<p>
Unusual names serve also to make the
characters more vivid to the reader's mind,
but this method of characterization is a crude
one that should give way to better ones
entailing no risk.
</p>

<p>
In humorous stories of a certain type they
are entirely legitimate.  On the other hand,
look carefully at your proper names lest, in a
serious story, you give a character a name
like "Hencastle" that brings a grin where you
do not wish to have a grin.
</p>

<p>
Alliterative proper names are another
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
phase of the evil in the case of readers
sufficiently sophisticated to note the alliteration
at all.
</p>

<p>
Avoid proper names that are difficult or
ambiguous of pronunciation.  Don't give
your characters the same names as those of
real people prominent in the public eye
unless a name is so common that it is not
likely to distract the reader from the story's
illusion through thoughts of the real person;
even a too similar name is risky in some
cases, <i>e.g.</i> any variation of the unusual name
"Roosevelt."
</p>

<p>
<i>Dialect</i>.—While belonging more properly
under later heads it serves, too, as a simple
distraction in itself.  Its advantages are
obvious, yet some readers will read no story
with dialect in it and some magazines will
print none.
</p>

<p>
<i>Mistakes</i>.—A typographical error, a mistake
in spelling, punctuation or English is
sure to check and drag out of the illusion any
reader who notes it.  Such matters are definitely
the editor's responsibility, but he is far
from infallible and the author would, in most
cases, profit by safeguarding against him.  An
editor will be grateful, particularly the assistant
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
editor who edits copy and reads proof.
In our own office we can quote you lots of
rules as to correct English—and show you
violations of them in our own pages.
</p>

<p>
Mistakes in fact and statement will be
considered later.
</p>

<p>
<i>Unusual Mannerisms of Style</i>.—Distinction
is to be made between, on the one hand,
individuality and deliberate shaping of style to
attain a particular atmosphere or suit
particular material and, on the other hand,
mannerisms that are necessary to neither of these
ends and harmful in distracting attention to
themselves.  No one can possibly draw a
definite line between these two groups, but a
warning is badly needed against forgetting
the danger.  It is a question for laboratory
test.  Try to get your friends—or better, your
enemies—to read your story with this point in
view, or do not mention it beforehand and
cross-examine them afterward as to what
mannerisms registered on their attention.
And don't hand-pick your critics or "dogs"
from any one class or group unless you mean
your story to appeal to no other.
</p>

<p>
A novelette, which had to be rewritten
because of it, used the following mannerism
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
hundreds and hundreds of times until each
recurrence was not only a distraction but an
agony: "he ran, and running, laughed aloud,"
"he sang, and singing, voiced his mood," "he
fought, and fighting, worked toward the
house."  Another writer habitually, in the
words following or introducing a line of
dialogue, carries the legitimate "he said," "he
urged," "he encouraged," etc., to such
distracting extremes as "he frightened," "he
anguished," "she informed," "he recognized,"
"he remorsed."  Of late years there has
developed the fad of saying "the heart, or soul,
or head, of him" for "his heart," "his soul,"
"his head," etc.  This variation from the usual
has, in prose, a very limited field in which its
advantage exceeds its damage.
</p>

<p>
A mannerism of style is warranted if it so
fits into a story that it is an integral and
practically unnoted part of it; otherwise it is a
harmful factor.  A better adapted mannerism
could have gained the desired effect without
making of itself an obtrusion.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fiction as a Vehicle</i>.—There are two ways
of writing a story.  One is to write fiction
only; the other is to combine fiction with
something else.  Readers like both and both
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
are legitimate, but the latter is of course not
pure fiction; fiction is merely the vehicle for
the other thing or things.  One of the greatest
evils among present-day fiction writers is the
failure to make this distinction and keep it
clearly in mind.  Too often a writer does not
realize that there is anything else mixed with
his fiction; consequently his product is not
straight or well-built fiction nor is the fiction
part of it a carefully made vehicle for the
other thing.
</p>

<p>
To make fiction serve any end other than
its own is very likely to weaken its value as
fiction, and before a writer thus weakens it
he should make very sure that the advantages
gained from making it carry something else
compensate for that weakening.  If he wishes
to give his reader, for example, some direct
philosophy, well and good, but he should—and
seldom does—weigh the attendant loss.
</p>

<p>
There is a second distinction that should be
made.  When I say "plus something else" I
mean plus something else that is added as a
load is put upon a wagon, not something that
comes to the reader as a result of the fiction.
To say in a story "a man may prosper exceedingly
on a policy of utter selfishness, but,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
having all his life taken without giving, in the end
he gives for what he took" is putting a load
on the wagon.  To let the story itself say that,
merely to tell a story that illustrates and
brings home that truth without mentioning it
specifically (unless through the mouth of a
character), is only letting straight fiction
perform a natural office, though a natural office
that can be overworked at the cost of a well
balanced whole.  The former is the easier
and less artistic method, and far too many
writers follow it far too often.  Its evil is that
of any "load"—it breaks the illusion, tending
to make the reader think of the person who
hands him this bit of philosophy, of himself,
of the world in general, instead of the story
world only.
</p>

<p>
The present-day fad of opening a story with
a bit of philosophy, though objectionable on
another score, does little damage to the
illusion, since it comes before the spell begins
and may even serve as an intermediate step.
</p>

<p>
<i>Obtrusion of Author</i>.—This is a crying evil,
a serious damage to the illusion.  The author
has no more business to appear concretely in
his story than a playwright has upon the stage
when his play is being acted.  Once in ten
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
thousand times he may himself be sufficiently
interesting to atone for the wreck of the
story's spell; the other nine thousand nine
hundred and ninety-nine times he is a mistake,
a bull in a china-shop.  The following,
all taken from submitted manuscripts, range
from crude to subtle obtrusions:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote" style="margin-left: 4em; text-indent: 0">
  "At the time of which I wish to speak"<br>
  "you must understand"<br>
  "consider the case of John Holt.  But first<br>
consider the environment"<br>
  "see him"<br>
  "and it is the correct word"<br>
  "it is necessary to add, in explanation of<br>
this seeming paradox"<br>
  "had, somewhat grumbingly, be it said,"<br>
  "he had, for instance, tried,"<br>
  "and disappears from this story,"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Each of these compels a reader to realize
that some one is talking to him.  You can't
be carried away in a dream when conscious
that some one is telling it to you.  Sometimes
the point is made that an author's obtrusion
puts the reader on more intimate terms with
him.  What has that to do with fiction as
such?  If the author didn't obtrude himself,
the reader would have no interest in intimacy
or non-intimacy with him.  If the author is
the one out of ten thousand, all right;
otherwise, not.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
</p>

<p>
If a writer must express philosophy or
opinions specifically, let him use the legitimate
device of the first-person narrative, taking
care that the narrator is cast in such
character as to make these opinions natural
to him.  Or else baldly use fiction as vehicle
only, making his story a conversazione.
</p>

<p>
There is another legitimate device.  Kipling
ends a story with "I think he was right."  But
he begins that story with "When I was
telling you of."  In other words, he tells the
story in an undeveloped frame or brackets.
Partly by leaving the frame undeveloped and
impersonal, his skill is sufficient to make you
feel that it is not Kipling himself who talks
to you, but some unknown participator in the
action of the story or an onlooker.  It is
really, in effect, a first-person narrative with
the privileges of such.
</p>

<p>
First-person narratives, unless presented
as addressed to a fictitious audience such as
the narrator's children or grandchildren, of
course permit a fairly free direct address to
or at the reader, since the writer poses as the
actual teller.  Incidentally, however, it is not
consistent with his telling what goes on inside
the characters unless made plain to him as
one of them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
</p>

<p>
As found in submitted manuscripts, the
great majority of authors' obtrusions seem
unconsidered, and are accompanied by the
damage to be expected from walking in the
dark.  The remainder, almost without exception,
seem ill-considered.  One exception out
of a thousand instances is not a heavy
average.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
CLEARNESS
</h3>

<p>
Anything that is not clear to a reader
either causes him to skip it and therefore miss
part of the story's substance and effect, or else
makes him puzzle.  In either case the illusion
suffers.  If he puzzles, he has to use up
attention on a point the writer had counted on
being clear, his mind is on the puzzle, not
obsessed by the spell; the story's flow is
stopped, the reader is conscious of himself,
his difficulty and limitations, perhaps also of
the author as the cause of his troubles—in a
word, the reader has got away.  Every time
you confuse him you lose him.  Deliberate
mystification is a writer's prerogative; having
all his plans upset by mystification where
none was expected or desired is a calamity.
</p>

<p>
<i>Author's Ostrich Habit</i>.—Naturally enough,
authors are inclined to a kind of reversed
ostrich habit.  If a point was clear to them
when they wrote it, they take for granted that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
it must be clear to the reader.  They forget
that they have full knowledge of all that is or
happens in their fiction, while the reader can
know only what comes to him from the
printed page.  Often when an editor points
out an unclearness they argue with him,
blissfully ignoring the fact that the editor is
himself a reader and that the reader found it
unclear.  Possibly the author proves his
case—that is, he points out other passages in the
story which do clear up the unclearness if the
reader remembers them and makes the correct
inferences and connections.  The fact
that, in the actual test, these passages failed
to produce the intended results on the reader
slides off the author like water off a duck.
Still less does he get the idea that a reader
shouldn't be distracted from the story by
being compelled to go into a more or less
complicated reasoning process in order to get
what should have been handed to him on a
platter.  Even if several editor-readers found
the point unclear, he stands by his guns.
</p>

<p>
Aside from the author's vastly superior
knowledge of his material and intentions,
many of his readers may be his mental
inferiors.  Also many of them may not be so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
interested in his story as he is and so give it less
close attention than he expects.  Part of them
habitually "skip" through a story and demand
a plain and shining path.  Certainly no
one mind is exactly like another and all readers
will not respond as does the author to any
given set of stimuli if even a tiny loophole is
left open.  A rule given playwrights is that if
it is essential to impress a basic point on the
audience, the point must be made at least
three times in the first scene.  So extreme a
rule is not needed for fiction, but the necessity
of clearness, even on minor points, is no
less pressing.
</p>

<p>
It is a natural and common mistake to
overestimate the average reader's interest
and attention and his ability and willingness
to solve puzzles when he sits down to read a
story.  A writer usually forgets that to the
reader his is merely one story out of dozens
or hundreds recently read, out of thousands
and ten thousands total.  The writer's
friend-critics have a personal interest in him and a
very special interest in his story that carry
them smilingly over many obstacles; to the
average reader the writer probably means
nothing whatsoever personally—quite
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
possibly his name at the head of the story was
not even read—and the story is merely one of
very many.  Any special attention to it must
be won by the writer's skill and careful work.
</p>

<p>
Talbot Mundy, knowing in advance the
general lines of this book, has furnished me
from his voluminous reading with various
quotations bearing on points covered, among
them this from Quintillian:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
"Care should be taken, not that the reader
may understand if he will, but that he must
understand, whether he will or not."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And from Whitman:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
"Nothing can make up for the lack of
definiteness."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Ambiguous Words and Sentences</i>.—Any
good text-book on English covers the subject
and most writers would profit by the study
thereof.  If when they try a short story out on
their friends they would ask for practical
detailed criticism on such points as this, they
would get laboratory results far more
valuable than the proverbially undependable
criticism of friends on the story as a whole.
</p>

<p>
<i>Proper Names</i>.—Be careful to give your
characters names no two of which are similar.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
The reader meets them for the first time and
has the task of identifying each name with
the proper character whenever it occurs.
Why confuse him with two characters named
"Lowe" and "Rowe," "Towne" and
"Browne," "Morgan" and "Mordan," or even
"Hadley" and "Hatfield"?  Yet many and
many a manuscript contains this needless
stumbling-block for readers.
</p>

<p>
The same mistake is made in names of
places, ships, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Another maddening and very common
practise among writers is to use sometimes a
character's last name, sometimes his first.
Even a short story with only two or three
characters can be made a needless omelette
of confusion, for this bad habit is extended to
include titles and nick-names or familiar
forms of the full names.  Consider "Doctor
James Stanley," "Edward D. Gage" and
"Captain John S. Tompkins."  "Gage" is a
lawyer and often called "Judge" by his
intimates.  "Tompkins'" lack of height earns
him the usual "Shorty."  The author uses
some of each, possibly for the sake of
"variety," and the three characters become, to the
reader, an army and hopelessly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
confused—"Stanley," "Ed," "Cap," "Gage," "Shorty,"
"Jim," "Judge," "John," "Doc," "Tompkins,"
"James," "Johnnie," "Edward."  Such a
confusion is alone enough to ruin the blissfully
unconscious writer's story.  For the simple
reason that readers can only half know what
is going on.  Yet in practise it is a very
common mistake.
</p>

<p>
<i>Technical and Foreign Words; Classical,
Historical and Fictional References and
Allusions</i>.—The confusion arises when a reader
happens not to understand the word, even
from the context, or to be unfamiliar with
the reference.  Writers seem to take it for
granted that all readers will grasp the meaning
without effort or delay.  Or mystify
deliberately to air their culture.  The warning
seems silly when set down on paper but is
warranted by the number of offenses in actual
practise.
</p>

<p>
<i>Naming Characters Early</i>.—Sometimes an
effect of reality is gained by not at once
naming characters in a story, giving the reader as
it were, the effect of looking down upon a new
world whose figures are no more known to
him than they would be at first sight in a real
scene.  Generally, however, a reader is likely
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
to resent being left to follow, for even a few
pages, the fortunes of a nameless person.
Include particularly the narrator in a
first-person story.
</p>

<p>
<i>Dialogue</i>.—Over and over again an editor
is compelled to go back over a passage of
dialogue in manuscript and "count out" with
finger or pencil until he finds a line that is
definitely connected with a particular
speaker.  The characters are not sufficiently
individualized to be recognized from their lines,
context fails to identify, the lines are not
labeled with the speakers' names and the
least flicker of attention leaves one lost at the
end of a dozen or even half a dozen speeches.
Sometimes the author himself gets lost and
mixes or omits.  An ordinary reader doesn't
have to "count out" as does the editor—he is
more likely to snort and pass on, with part of
the story lost to him and its net register on
him badly damaged.  If he doesn't snort and
pass on he stops to puzzle it out.  Why injure
a story by so crude an omission?
</p>

<p>
<i>Too Many Characters</i>.—The heading is
self-explanatory.  All the characters in any story
are utter strangers to the reader until he
becomes familiar with them; he can keep clear
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
in his mind only a limited number of new
acquaintances all made in the course of a few
minutes; the kind of writer who uses many
characters is usually the kind who is unable
to individualize them with any vividness.  A
novel or novelette gives greater scope, but in
a short story it may almost be given as a
general rule that the fewer the characters, the
stronger the story, not counting characters
used in blocks, such as mobs, armies, spectators.
Structure and proportion, as well as
clearness, are of course involved.
</p>

<p>
<i>Dialect and Slang</i>.—Neither is familiar in
all places or to all classes, and on the point of
clearness both are to be condemned.  Their
advantages will be considered later.
</p>

<p>
The stupidest blunder in handling dialect
is to misspell a word without really changing
its pronunciation, thus confusing the reader's
eye yet gaining only the appearance of
dialect—and the reader's irritation.
</p>

<p>
<i>Contradictions and Inconsistencies</i>.—Their
variety is infinite and their occurrence in
submitted manuscripts frequent beyond the
belief of those who read only the corrected
printed page.  A woman changes the color of
her eyes; with a conversation that could
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
occupy only one minute there is coincident
action that couldn't possibly be compressed
into five, or, <i>very</i> commonly, a bland lapse of
even more time without any action; a
six-shooter emits seven shots without reloading;
of a party of fourteen, five turn back and ten
remain; a character uses a word that would
never be used by such a person in real life,
or acts, without explanation, entirely at
variance with his nature as the author has
pictured it; the hero acts on information he has
not yet received; a man's name changes
during the story; a woman opens a door already
open; a character goes somewhere else without
leaving or becomes present without arriving.
When you encounter such a break in a
printed story doesn't it jar you out of the
illusion, lessen your respect for the author,
and therefore permanently damage his story's
hold on you?
</p>

<p>
There can be no general rule for correction.
When not the result of sheer carelessness and
indifference, such errors are due to the
author's failure to visualize, to live his scenes
himself.  This failure in some cases is due to
real inability or comparative inability, but in
very many cases to attention so obsessed and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
ridden by principles of plot, rules for character
drawing, regulations for niceties of style,
application of technique in general and
requirements of various magazines that there's
no brain-force left for making the story
world a really convincing and natural one in
its all important details.
</p>

<p>
<i>Holding Reader to Correct Plot Line</i>.—In
other words, proportion and emphasis.  Briefly
stated, what is meant here is clearness of
path for the reader through the incidents of
the story, so that his mind will follow or leap
ahead only in the exact direction the author
wishes for the fullest effectiveness of his
story.  This will be taken up in detail later.
</p>

<p>
<i>Simplicity</i>.—The following from Schopenhauer
(thanks to Mr. Mundy) gives us the
heart of the matter:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
"Nothing is easier than to write so that no
one can understand; just as, contrarily,
nothing is more difficult than to express deep
things in such a way that every one must
necessarily grasp them."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Yet to most of those sending manuscripts
to magazines simplicity, particularly simplicity
in words and style, is very pointedly
something to be avoided whatever else is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
done or left undone.  The twin cause of this
appalling idea, this curse stupidly laid upon
American fiction, is the firmly rooted belief
that literature must be an expression that is,
first, unnatural, second, learned, recondite,
even sophomoric.  In its lowest and very
common form it is no more than the crude idea
that editors must be very scholarly persons
and that therefore they would scorn any
manuscript that didn't have a lot of "big
words" in it.  The simple language of
Shakespeare, Homer, Virgil, the Bible and other
really enduring classics loom before their
eyes, but no, they follow the jack-o'-lantern
of "big words."  They have this excuse—much
of the fiction published in magazines and
books is fairly rotten with "big words," a
reflection on editors and reading public as well
as writers.
</p>

<p>
The hard practical argument against "dictionary
words" is that most people find them
difficult to understand or at least lack the
definite, vivid, full connotation for them that
they have for the simpler and more common
words of our very rich language.  Such words
reduce the size of an author's fully appreciative
audience.  Another point is that the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
writer who doesn't know any better than to
make a business of using them is very often
himself lacking in an understanding of their
finer shades of meaning.  A third point is
that, unless such words are part of his own
every-day vocabulary he is being unnatural
in using them and thereby ruins his chances
of attaining real style or producing real
literature.  Also he gives through them to his
story an unnatural, artificial quality, an air
of being forced.  In the eyes of all those with
a real understanding of real literature he
makes of himself a plain darned fool.
</p>

<p>
But can there be no great literature without
simplicity?  None that couldn't be greater
with it.  A straight line is the shortest
distance between two points; any deviation from
it is lost motion, unnecessary; the best
literature contains no lost motion and nothing
that is unnecessary.  But is not a "big word"
sometimes the straight line?  Yes, but for one
case of this kind there are twenty when it is
not.  Sometimes the author uses it for a
simpler phrasing not sufficiently mastered to
come to mind at need; sometimes it is necessary
only because he has committed himself
by some roundabout phrasing demanding it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
for completion; sometimes he commits himself
to it by following the inferior method of
telling the reader what is inside a character
instead of making it plain through what the
character says and does and what other
characters say and do to him.
</p>

<p>
The final test for the use of "big words" is
the nature of the material or ideas handled.
In some cases they are necessary to a degree,
sometimes to a great degree.  But in practise
the nature of the material is generally not
correctly assayed, or is mishandled, or the
need imagined.  The ignorant use them
through ignorance; for those with a good
knowledge of words it is generally easier to
use the "big word," the Latin derivative
instead of the simpler Anglo-Saxon.
</p>

<p>
Is it not therefore more natural and so
better for this last class to use the "big word"?
That depends on why it is natural—or on
whether it is natural or merely habitual.  A
writer may have come into the use of them,
not by natural development but through
deliberate effort, a stunt for the sake of seeming
learned or being impressive, so that their use,
while easy to him, is merely the result of his
having made of himself a kind of abnormality—an
artificial result of artificial talking
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
and method of thought.  On the other hand
is the far rarer case of him whose mind
naturally expresses itself through polysyllables,
generally because of an education from books
instead of people.  I know one writer who
spoke to no one for two years except for the
barest necessities because when he used what
to him was perfectly natural language the
people he met thought he was "stuck up" or
showing off.
</p>

<p>
I do not know why Henry James wrote as
he did, but contrast the two following cases:
</p>

<p>
I once shared an apartment with an ardent
admirer of James and as I did not share his
admiration we argued frequently.  James
came to New York while my friend was
preparing a bibliography of his idol's works.
There was some question as to several early
articles or stories that had magazine but not
book publication and my friend wrote for
the simple information necessary.  It could
have been given amply and courteously in
two or three sentences.  The reply was
appalling in its totally unnecessary complexity,
length and creation of detail, so much so that
my friend woke me up to show it to me and
joined in my unholy glee.  It was, surely, a
natural expression, but why was it natural?
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
And certainly it was not adapted to the
nature of the material or idea.
</p>

<p>
Now read the first one hundred and fifty
words of <i>A Coward</i> by De Maupassant, even
in translation, then write down the things
you know about the character described in
those few very simple words and you will be
amazed at the length of the list.
</p>

<p>
Consider that De Maupassant and his master
Flaubert stand preeminently for unrelenting
search for "the one word" and that
both of them are characterized by extreme
simplicity of presentation.  And is any
character of Henry James' so much more
intricately drawn than "Madame Bovary"?
</p>

<p>
Among more modern writers take Joseph
Conrad.  I am a Conrad "fan," but consider
him, comparatively speaking, a poor workman
though a great artist.  Here we have
simplicity of words but not of expression in
a general sense.  I do not by any means fully
understand most of his stories and I find that
others are about equally at sea if they are
honest or are cross-examined.  In most of the
qualities that make a great fictionist he
stands in the front rank, but he is lacking in
<i>corresponding</i> ability to simplify and clarify
his thought, to make the proper abstraction
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
and selection of thought expressions.  His
content and gifts are so rich that even only a
part of them registered on readers is
sufficient to rate him a master, but the fact
remains that he conveys only a part of what
he has to say.  Instead of a direct, clear-cut,
simple path to his goal he gives the reader a
maze of paths that is not lacking in blind
alleys.
</p>

<p>
Whatever be the generally accepted academic
philosophy of simple versus complex
expression, it can not outface the fact that
the minority of readers can not so fully
understand or appreciate complexity and that
with them the effectiveness of a story is
thereby crippled.  Certainly in practise there
is crying need for the mastery that can say
all yet say it simply.  If, instead of straining
for complexity, beginners would aim at
simplicity, especially of words, they would not
only come closer to writing both good
magazine stories and good literature, but would
find themselves able to "handle" greater and
greater complexity of thought and with a
precision and effectiveness that can not be
equaled by the other method.
</p>

<p>
Remember that the simple, every-day words
are in almost all cases the <i>stronger</i> ones.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>

<p>
<i>Repetition</i>.—Before leaving the subject of
clearness as a whole (it will come up again
in connection with other subjects), a word
might be ventured on repetition.  The present
horror of it is a badly exaggerated reaction.
To repeat without due cause an unusual word
or phrase in a short story, or a usual one too
close to its first use, is a distraction and
therefore harmful to the illusion, but sometimes
due cause is ignored.  A story, all so clear to
its author, presents hundred of facts with
which the reader must familiarize himself.
The easier you make this for him and the
more you insure his getting all the points
necessary to a full appreciation of your story,
the more fully will your story register on him.
To present a vital point once so vividly that
it is almost sure to register is best of all and
correspondingly difficult to do, but keep your
eyes open for cases where repetition, probably
not in exactly the same words, will
accomplish the same purpose nearly as well
and perhaps more surely.
</p>

<p>
Aside from clearness, in skilful hands
repetition can become a most subtle and
powerful instrument for dramatic and poetic
effects of high literary quality.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
OVERSTRAIN
</h3>

<p>
A reader has just so much of attention,
interest and appreciation to give to any story
and, to hold him in the illusion, it is of the
highest importance not to wear him out before
you are through with him and not to use
him up on minor points or on matters that
should put upon him no strain whatever.
</p>

<p>
<i>Brevity</i>.—Most of all, don't talk too much
or too long.  A story is never so dead as when
buried in words.  Most of the stories
submitted can be cut to advantage, often very
heavily cut.  The reader gets worn out waiting
for something to happen—is bored by
being told in a hundred words what he could
have grasped in twenty.
</p>

<p>
Do not feel that you must give the entire
history of the hero's life in a short story;
only a certain few incidents and facts have
direct bearing and the remainder must be
mercilessly cut out.  Nor all the scenes and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
action of any story.  Make it your object to
have as much as possible happen off-stage;
what forces itself to the footlights will
probably belong there.
</p>

<p>
<i>Unclearnesses and Distractions</i>.—Any
unclearness or ambiguity or any distraction is
of course a profitless strain upon the reader.
Don't compel a reader to <i>reason</i> out things
that should be clear at a glance.  Even the
intentional unclearness of subtlety, though
by no means a fault, must also be weighed
as to disadvantage in strain.
</p>

<p>
All the points covered in Chapter VI apply
in this one.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sentence Length</i>.—Vary it.  If you can,
vary it in accordance with variation in
emotions of material, in desired effects on reader,
but vary it in any case.  The very monotony
of a long succession of either long or short
sentences is wearing.
</p>

<p>
Don't drag a reader through a sentence so
long that in following it he tires out before
he can draw mental breath.
</p>

<p>
<i>Hold Reader to Correct Plot Line</i>.—From
first word to last, don't wear him out by
letting him cover useless distance over false
trails.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Classical and Other References</i>.—In
addition to their dangers of distraction and
unclearness they force a reader, if they reach
him, to picture or consider characters, events
and scenes in addition to those of the story.
They are of course justified in comparatively
rare instances.
</p>

<p>
<i>Dialect, Archaic Speech, Slang, Foreign,
Unusual and Technical Words</i>.—All these
offer obstacles to at least part of your
audience.  To a probable minority dialect is a
delight, it is of course necessary to faithful
realism, and it undoubtedly gives color.  Yet
many will not read a dialect story, their chief
reason being the labor necessary to understand
it.  There are, too, those who consciously
or unconsciously object to anything
foreign, meaning by foreign anything different
from their own.  It is, for the author, a
question of weighing advantages against
disadvantages.  Archaic speech, as far as strain
is concerned, is merely dialect.  One writer
makes the rule of using the speech of the
time in which his story is laid for all periods
following and including that of Elizabeth,
using modern English for all earlier periods,
his argument being that her reign
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
approximately draws the line between speech that
is now intelligible with little or no effort and
speech that is not.  Archaic forms of foreign
tongues must be rendered to us in English, so
fall under the same rule.
</p>

<p>
Slang, too, is to be weighed as to advantages
and disadvantages.  It is perhaps more difficult
than in the cases of dialect and archaic
speech to compute the proportion of readers
to whom it will be sufficiently intelligible.
On the other hand, it is generally in itself
humorous and therefore of particular value
when a humorous effect is desired; gives
color; aids in characterization.
</p>

<p>
The danger of foreign, unusual and technical
words is much the same on the score of
strain as on the score of distraction and
unclearness.
</p>

<p>
<i>Relief Scenes</i>.—At some point a reader's
response to a demand on his emotions ceases
and he grows callous to the appeal, but
writers often forget this fact and continue to
demand long after he has lost his ability to
respond.  Perfection is to bring him to your
climax at the full flood of response, but to do
so requires careful handling.  A steady,
gentle increase of demand is best if you can be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
absolutely sure of results, but a most useful
safeguard is the use of relief scenes.  If
you've keyed him up to a dangerously high
pitch, give him a rest-scene before you add a
further call upon his emotions—shift the
scene or time and let him look a moment at
a quiet landscape or gentle action.  Make the
change a decided one and you not only rest
him but profit by the sharp dramatic
contrast between the relief scene and those
following and preceding it.*
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
*Read De Quincey's <i>On the Knocking at the Gate in
"Macbeth."</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Frames or Brackets</i>.—That is, a story
within a story—a story one of whose characters
tells the main story.  Its advantage is a
gain in semblance of reality—if it is handled
with sufficient skill.  It very seldom is.  Its
disadvantage is an overstrain, in demanding
of the reader that he form two illusions
instead of one, and a consequent dividing and
weakening of attention.  Having accomplished
the task of getting clear in his mind
one setting and one set of characters, he is
forced to take up a new set of characters and
probably a new setting, a double strain within
the compass of a single story.  If, as is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
often the case, a character in the frame (or
several characters) persists in interrupting
the course of the inner, the real story,
conflict or confusion of illusion is compounded.
</p>

<p>
Most writers could profit by not attempting
the doubly difficult task of a bracketed or
framed story.  Unless exceptional skill is
brought to bear, the frame-story is almost
sure either to be too slight and unconvincing
or to be made more or less convincing by
being developed at such length that it is too
serious an encroachment upon space needed
for the real story.  Yet it is a favorite attempt
with those least able to handle it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Mystery Stories</i>.—These must be considered
as a class by themselves, for their deliberate
intent is to make the reader strain at
solving a puzzle or at following its intricate
presentation and solution, and he turns to
them at least partly for the mental stimulus
involved.  Yet overstrain is entirely possible.
In fact, this type, by reason of its inherent
intricacy and effort for the reader, demands
particularly that he be not compelled to
strain over points that are non-essential to
the mystery proper.  Unskilled or unfair
writers sometimes intentionally add
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
confusions that are in no way necessary, and
many a mystery story lessens its hold on
readers by unintended unclearnesses or
suggestions that mislead in unnecessary
directions and to no purpose.  A reader may like
to solve puzzles, but he most emphatically
has the right to be at all times clear as to just
what the puzzle is.
</p>

<p>
<i>Plot</i>.—Unnecessary intricacy, of course,
should be avoided in any type of story; the
difficulty in a given case is to draw the line
between necessary and unnecessary.  But for
any writer who has not made very decided
progress toward mastering his art a fairly
safe rule is to simplify his plot as much as
possible.  Perhaps that plot might be made
more effective if developed in greater intricacy
by skilled hands, but his hands are probably
not sufficiently skilful and the net result
of his attempt is likely to be a reader
worn out by too many loosely knit threads
of plot.  As he grows in skill he will find that
more and more intricate plots become—for
him—simple plots and therefore to be
undertaken with confidence.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
CONVINCINGNESS
</h3>

<p>
Among writers of some experience the
rejection of a manuscript for the quite
common reason that it is "not convincing" is often
considered merely the editor's slipshod,
evasive or ignorant excuse given in place of
some mysterious real reason or through lack
of any definite one.  Sometimes it is, but,
when honestly and intelligently given, it is
the best possible reason for rejection.
"Unconvincingness" means definitely and directly
that a story fails to impose its illusion—that
it is merely words for the reader to
look at, not a world for him to live in.  It
is the death-knell to the illusion.
</p>

<p>
An editor's failure to give the reasons why
it is "not convincing" may be due to his not
having analyzed beyond the general effect,
but it may be simply because unconvincingness
is not easy to reduce to black and white
and at best involves far more detail than his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
time permits him to handle.  It is as various
and elusive as human nature itself, but the
more common causes can be fairly well indicated.
</p>

<p>
<i>Improbabilities and Impossibilities</i>.—Contradictions
and inconsistencies have already
been considered in Chapter VI and are to be
included under this head.  Improbability and
impossibility are of course relative terms;
a wishing-ring, while an utter impossibility
in reality, is not even an improbability in a
story of fairies; if the reader accepts the
major illusion of fairy-land there will be no
difficulty to his accepting the minor illusion
of a wishing-ring.  But in a story of anything
approaching real life absolute conformity to
the laws and facts of real life is relentlessly
exacted, and in stories dependent upon the
acceptance of some fundamental premise,
like the reality of fairy-land or the possibility
of being transferred into the year 2022, there
must be equally relentless conformity to the
condition of the premise.
</p>

<p>
I venture that not twenty per cent. of
<i>accepted</i> manuscripts are entirely free from
slips of this kind when submitted.  Acceptance
has been in spite of them, each of them
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
lessened the chances of acceptance, and
sufficient increase in their number would have
meant rejection by any good magazine.
There is, of course, the type of story that
depends upon sheer quantity and tenseness of
action to carry the reader along, despite all
inconsistencies and improbabilities—the
"dime novel" type, but all the strain of a
bridge should not be upon a single girder.
</p>

<p>
<i>Improbabilities of Plot</i>.—Too infinite in
variety for any attempt at classification.
The test in each case must reduce first to,
"Could it happen under the conditions?"  And
the writer—with help from his friends
if they can be induced to help in this more
practical fashion—must be the judge.  Then
he must narrow his question to, "Is it so likely
to happen that the reader will accept it
<i>without hesitation</i>?"  Here is the real test and
most writers fail to meet it largely because
they have not, under the present system of
teaching fiction, been trained to measure a
story strictly through the reader's eyes.  Many
a time every editor has been "caught" by an
author who wrote back gleefully or vindictively
"but it actually happened in real
life!"  Doubtless, but that doesn't mean anything.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
It may have happened a thousand times in
real life, but if readers can not believe it
when they find it in a story it is none the
less an improbability in that story, a blow to
convincingness, a check to the reader, an
injury to the illusion.
</p>

<p>
I have struggled so often, and so often
vainly, to make writers realize this distinction
that I come to it now girded for the fray.
Can't they see that a fact can not be a fact
to a reader if he refuses to consider it a fact?
Are they so hopelessly egotistic in their
outlook on life that, because an improbable or
unusual thing has occurred in their personal
experience, it has thereby demonstrated its
possibility to every one else?  Are they so
sickeningly conceited as to be sure that their
presentation of the fact is as convincing to
others as was the fact itself to them?  Are
they so imbecile as not to see that "proving"
it to an editor <i>after</i> the reading of the story
does not in any way prove it to the next or
any reader <i>while</i> he is reading it?  That, if
it were published, they would never have
the chance to prove it afterward in the case
of readers as they had had in the case of the
editor?  That readers, ninety-nine times out
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
of a hundred, would not even bother to
challenge the author on the point but would
merely class him as "punk" and his story as
"bunk" and go on to the next in the
thousands of stories they read?
</p>

<p>
Ah, no, it "really happened" somewhere!
That ought to be enough for anybody, even
if he doesn't know it happened and is
convinced that it couldn't and knows mighty well
that it is contrary to his own experience!
</p>

<p>
A leprechawn or a magic carpet can be
made entirely convincing as part of the
story's illusion by sufficient skill and in the
proper setting, while the wonderful drive you
and a half-dozen other witnesses saw John
R. Smith make, on your club links a week ago
Wednesday can, if put into a story, seem
nothing whatever but a crude lie.  Verily,
truth is stranger than fiction—particularly
good fiction.  Good fiction makes a business
of being a little less strange than truth
sometimes is, so that it can be believed.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, a "really happened"
incident is likely to need twice the amount of
"framing up" that an imaginary but more
usual one would require.
</p>

<p>
The true addict to this stupid and stubborn
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
point of view scorns the simple device, used
by his betters, of presenting the unusual <i>as</i>
an unusual thing.  No, it must be accepted as
normal; it happened, you've got to believe it.
It doesn't occur to him that it was unusual to
him, that he seized upon it as material for
that very reason, that it would be equally
unusual to the characters in his story and that,
really to duplicate or simulate life, he must
make his characters register the same
surprise and interest that he himself felt as a
result of its unusualness.  You can make a
reader accept something as a remarkable
occurrence which he would utterly reject as a
normal happening.
</p>

<p>
For example, take the common case of
the very feminine heroine who goes through
the author's best hell of horror, desperation,
bodily strain and general nerve-shock and,
when rescued at its very climax, at once
blandly regains almost entire poise and
enunciates a very charming love-passage or goes
cheerfully and competently about her other
business.  Most of us know that it is
characteristic of the female sex to rise to an
emergency strain and collapse or violently react
the instant the demand is removed if not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
before.  Consequently said heroine fails to
convince.  The author's logical correction is
to make this heroine conform to general
experience, but, if he simply can not or will not
change this part of his plot, why not give
what convincingness he may by making her
show at least some effects of the strain, or
making clear that reaction had not yet come,
or at least some such crude but comparatively
desirable device as "strangely
enough"?
</p>

<p>
<i>Improbabilities of Character</i>.—Like human
nature, too various for specific classification.
Most writers are capable of at least some
understanding of human nature and a weakness
along these lines can be partly corrected by
a combination of earnest study and sincere
care.  Failure to draw character convincingly
is an absolute limit to success except in the
lowest grades of fiction and in such uncommon
types of story as are in no way dependent
for interest upon fidelity to human
nature.
</p>

<p>
The wire-nerved heroine cited above is an
example.  Any expression, thought, emotion
or act assigned to a character to whom, as
drawn, it would not be natural helps destroy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
the reality of that character—the word
"grievously" or "interrelation" in the mouth
of an ignorant, illiterate character; a thought
of the Virgin Mary in the mind of a Protestant
during a crisis; a feeling of pity, not
specified as unusual, in a pitiless person;
fumbling in an emergency by a man drawn
as cool, clear-headed and ready.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lack of Characterization</i>.—Unless a character
is given at least a semblance of
individualization he will be unlike any human in
real life or else will be like some human
viewed from a distant mountain-top or air-ship,
in either case unconvincing as a "close
up."  Yet in the vast majority of submitted
manuscripts characters are proper names
and nothing more.  This will be taken up in
the chapter on "Characterization."
</p>

<p>
<i>Clanking Plots</i>.—"The framework shows
through," "you can hear the machinery go
round," "artificial"—such plots are like the
doggerel whose author does violence to both
content and expression in order to get at the
ends of lines words that approximate a
rhyme.  Lack of plot is almost a synonym.
Instead of building a plot that is the natural
result of character, conditions or conflicting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
forces, the author draws at will upon the
universe at large for whatever elements will lend
what he considers strength and effectiveness.
Since the law of cause and effect holds in
real life, such a plot is unconvincing.  In
reading even published stories haven't you
often found something said or done that was
obviously put into the story, not for its
intrinsic or relative value, but solely for the
plot-purpose of making other things connect
and keep moving?  And what is the effect
upon your belief in the story, upon your
illusion?
</p>

<p>
<i>Hack Plots</i>.—I've forgotten who first said
that there are only seven—or is it nine or
five?—plots in the world, but, whoever he
was, he's done a good deal of damage.  With
that hopeless dictum looming before their
eyes it is not to be wondered at that many
writers strive half-heartedly or not at all for
originality of plot.  Add this to the majority's
lack of invention, our ingrained habit of
copying and a tendency to take rather than
make and you can see why an editor can
reject at a glance a large proportion of
submitted stories.  Like any other reader, he
has very thoroughly learned some scores of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
plots or plot variations and doesn't need to
read them any more.  Usually the author
who turns in a hack plot is the author who
has little to offer except plot.  And quite
often he answers a rejection for hack plot by
quoting "there are only five plots in the world
anyway."  If that is so, five is enough to
enable better writers to write better stories.
</p>

<p>
The patent objection to hack plots is that
they have outworn, with all but the newest
and most elemental readers, the power to
hold in illusion, therefore demanding an
extra amount of excellence in other factors.
There is also the objection that this very
repetition of a formula identified with fiction,
particularly poor fiction, gives them at once
the flavor of fiction instead of real life, and
successful illusion is thus made extremely
difficult.
</p>

<p>
As a lonely little plea in behalf of wearied
editors, couldn't you arrange, when you wish
to shoot or stab a character without
removing him entirely, to wound him somewhere
else than in the shoulder?  The bullet that
proved merely to have glanced off the skull
is also rather overworked.  And must you
turn for help to overheard conversations?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Coincidence</i>.—Coincidence is such a favorite
device for attaining a hack plot, a clanking
plot and improbability in general that it calls
for a separate and emphatic warning.  A
reader's credence for coincidences is strictly
limited, especially if they are presented as
matters of course.
</p>

<p>
<i>Hack Style</i>.—Objectionable for the same
reason as hack plot.  The inevitable
connotation of hack words and phrases is of the
"writing game," of the printed page, of stories
sold for money, not of real life—too
"magaziney" to be successful in holding illusions
in which magazines can have practically no
place.  Each hack phrase, moreover, is a lost
opportunity for a right phrase that would
have added to effectiveness.  Also, readers
are just plain tired of them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Frames or Brackets and First-Person
Narratives</i>.—Guard against letting the
frame-story character who tells the real story talk
so long, fluently and perfectly that readers
will note the impossibility of his performing
such a feat in real life.  First-person narratives,
not in a frame, generally avoid this
impossibility by having the narrative written
instead of spoken; otherwise they run the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
same danger.  Most of all, don't let the
narrator abandon his own speech for that of the
author himself.  He generally does.
</p>

<p>
<i>Dialect, Slang, Foreign Words</i>.—All these,
rightly used, tend toward convincingness of
color and character, but their effectiveness is
often measured by suggestion rather than
quantity.  Broad Scotch dialect at full strength
will give a very Scotch atmosphere, for
example, but many readers will refuse to enter
that atmosphere or will become lost in it if
they do enter.  Often idiom is a more effective
device than dialect.
</p>

<p>
<i>Ignorance of Material: Mistakes</i>.—There is,
heaven knows, just ground for the belief that
writers are given to writing of things with
which they are not sufficiently familiar.
Instead of using the material they know best, as
a class they are too prone to select the
material they'd like to know about but don't.
Also to feign a scholarliness they don't
possess or to attempt a style they have not
mastered.
</p>

<p>
Lack or loss of faith in the author is as
great a catastrophe as lack or loss of belief
in the story.  Irritation against him is still
more fatal.  If you have any doubt, an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
editor's mail would dispel it.  Nothing brings so
many or such bitter protests from readers as
a mistake in handling local color.  Mark that
well, you who "take a chance" because you
think you can—and often do—"get away with
it."  Not only do you underestimate the
irritation, sometimes amounting to a virulence that
remembers you and follows you with hostility
through your other stories, but your ignorance
of setting, local color, material blinds
you to the infinite possibility for unconscious
mistakes that are instantly detected by those
who know and make you ridiculous in their
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Your dialect, slang and foreign quotations
gain you no color if you make mistakes in
them.  Classical, historical and fictional
references, or "big words" in English, if
incorrectly used, give you no reputation for
scholarliness.  Having your villain run lightly
away with more dollars in gold or dust than
he could lift from the ground or using an
"automatic revolver" does not impress
readers with your knowledge of what you write
about.  Giving Brazilians Spanish as their
native tongue produces very unlocal color.  A
negro strain in a pure-blooded Creole shows
no knowledge of types.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
</p>

<p>
Add to these the mistakes considered in the
chapter on "Distractions," add all the other
mistakes of which the uninformed human
brain is capable, and then take up your heavy
burden of becoming thoroughly familiar with
the material you use in stories.  A month or
two in a locality will not give to any save a
Kipling sufficient familiarity for safety.
Most writers think it will.  And, whatever you
do, don't fool with fire-arms or with anything
pertaining to ships until you have become a
real authority!  I speak from bitter experience;
editor, as well as writer, becomes the
target for almost venomous ire.  And no detail
is too tiny for detection and wrath.  The
picture of a grizzly bear on a magazine cover
brought a vicious indictment because, while
a grizzly has six toes, not five, he does not
show the sixth toe especially when in the
position depicted.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The convincingness of a story as a whole,
then, is dependent upon many detailed factors
and there is some excuse for the editor
who does not give the analyzed reasons for
his verdict of "unconvincing."
</p>

<p>
Such a weakness is due, on one hand, to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
ignorance, deliberate indifference or almost
criminal carelessness or, on the other hand,
to failure to visualize clearly from the point
of view of the reader.  The most practical
remedy, for both classes of causes, is, aside
from the writer's own efforts, a fundamental
change in teaching methods, putting far more
emphasis upon training writers to habitual
and very anxious consideration of the reader's
actual reactions to every least stimulus
in a story.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
HOLDING THE READER
</h3>

<p>
While most points that bear here fall more
directly under other headings, some definitely
belong in this chapter.  And, though I
know of no recipe for being interesting, there
are certain things that may be of help to that
effort.
</p>

<p>
<i>Being Dramatic</i>.—All stories, to be
interesting, I think, must be dramatic, in the
broader sense of the word, both in style and
in selection and recombination of material.
The very demand for unity and structure is
a demand for the dramatic, the dramatic
quality being largely a matter of position and
contrast, and a baldly unemotional or
matter-of-fact style can be strongly dramatic
through its contrast with the emotional
material handled.  However, lest I be confounded
by the philosophers, I'll discard "Being
Dramatic" and attempt instead, suggestions
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
as to "being interesting," not with any idea of
covering the subjects completely but rather,
(as in much of this book), calling attention to
points on which writers prove themselves
particularly weak in actual practise and
which seem to call for more attention in
teaching methods.
</p>

<p>
<i>Suspense</i>.—The chief warning needed is
not to spoil it after you've secured it.  Over
and over again a writer ruins his reader's
suspense by betraying the plot in advance and
making a surprise impossible.  Sometimes it
is inadvertent, but often it is deliberately
done by at least a general statement or hint
of outcome prefaced with some such phrase
as "little did I know then that," "could he
have known," "in the light of what followed
there was no need for my next step," etc., or
even more baldly betraying, say, the outcome
of an entire book whose interest is at least
partly based on whether hero wins heroine,
by such as "Now, with Nita and our children
sitting by me as I write, my doubts seem
foolish ones."
</p>

<p>
To me one of the most amazing faults in
the entire repertoire is the flat betrayal of
plot by the chapter headings.  Why do it?  Is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
it merely a slip due to concentration on the
really nerve-racking task of choosing an
interesting and pertinent title for the chapter?
Or is the habit of not measuring by the reader's
reactions so strong that in so prominent
and spectacular a place a writer does not
even note that he has advertised in advance
to readers the very thing he should be trying
to keep as a surprise?
</p>

<p>
<i>Surprises</i>.—Be sure they are legitimate.  It
is one thing to shape a story so that the
reader will expect other than what is to
happen, but quite another for you to tell him
definitely that he is to expect the other.  Yet
some writers do this.
</p>

<p>
<i>Mystery</i>.—Naturally, play upon human
curiosity and the human hunting-instinct
whenever opportunity offers, but, as in the
case of surprises, be sure your mystery
structure and detail play fair with the reader.
Here, too, you may give him false scents to
follow, for he accepts them as part of the
game, but, to change the figure, be sure that
the ladder by which the goal is finally
reached has no rungs missing.  And in heaven's
name don't fog your story with the needless
mysteries of careless unclearness and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
confusion when nothing but irritation is to be
gained by it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Overstrain</i>.—Already covered.  But some
of its points demand extra attention for the
sake of dramatic effect.
</p>

<p>
<i>Light and Shade</i>.—Their proper use is
essential to mastery of dramatic effect.  Just as
a square of black on a white sheet stands out
far blacker and stronger than on a black one,
just so does a strong scene stand out stronger
if preceded and perhaps followed by a quiet
scene than if merely one in a succession of
strong scenes.  Such a succession, properly
handled for cumulative effect and steady rise
to a climax, may as a whole be stronger than
an alternation of strong and quiet, but such a
succession is itself a unit and as such subject
to the general law.  There is always the
danger of overstrain in its use.
</p>

<p>
The above applies, of course, to the
elements within a scene, in the make-up of a
character, or in anything else.  For example,
the traits of a character all good or all bad
are not so vivid as those of a character partly
good and partly bad—nor is the character so
natural.
</p>

<p>
The element of unexpectedness in the sense
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
of particularly sudden surprise is extremely
effective by reason of the sharp contrast
involved.
</p>

<p>
<i>Repression</i>.—Often more effective than
expression of emotion, for the fundamental
reason, particularly in the case of emotion felt
by a character, that, however strong the
emotion, repression means the addition of
something sufficiently stronger to master it and
of a struggle for the mastery, even though
neither is definitely described in the story.
There is contrast between emotion and will,
between the expression to be expected and
the absence of it, perhaps between one character's
repression and another's lack of it.  In
the case of repression by the author in the
general handling of a scene an advantage lies
in his giving to each reader opportunity to
fill out the emotion in whatever way is most
satisfying and natural to each from the mere
skilful stimulus furnished by the author.  If
this advantage seems slight, consider the
drawings for an illustrated story.  In how
many cases does the artist's conception of
characters, scene and expression coincide
with that of a reader?  Supposing it were
possible for the artist to furnish only such
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
suggestions as would enable each reader to
fill out a picture in accordance with his own
conception, would not each reader find it
more satisfying?  Incidentally, would it be
a higher form of art?
</p>

<p>
Also there is enough of the Anglo-Saxon in
our national character to implant in perhaps
most of us an impulse to run away from too
free expression of emotion.  A reader's
impulse to run away from a story does not add
to its effectiveness.
</p>

<p>
Certainly repression of emotion in the
sense of condensing the number of words
used in expression could be practised to great
advantage by the majority of writers.
</p>

<p>
But, first, last and always, remember that
repressing emotion should seldom mean
annihilating.  Perhaps the correct idea is shown
by contrasting a spiral spring compressed to
its least space and greatest potential force
with the same spring spent from being
sprung, or with the absence of a spring.
</p>

<p>
<i>Omitting Scenes</i>.—A story is at bottom a
selection of certain bits of material from an
almost infinite number of bits or, put the
other way, the rejection of all material except
the salient bits.  Dramatic effect is often
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
increased by keying the process of selection and
abstraction to a more rigid scale, even rejecting
comparatively salient bits.  For example,
a whole scene, though fitting into the story's
development, may lend greater effectiveness
to the whole by being inferred instead of
enacted on stage.
</p>

<p>
<i>Condensation</i>.—It is safe to say that many
writers could make most of their stories not
only more dramatic but more effective in
general by greater condensation.  Those of
you, especially, who aim for popularity rather
than the judgment of posterity should
remember that we live in an age of motion-pictures,
that one of their chief characteristics
is speed, and that our youth are growing up
with that speed more or less fixed in their
minds as a standard for all narrative or
expository art.  What will they, consequently,
demand of fiction?  Are they becoming
impatient of what we have considered the
normal speed of fiction narrative?  Just as they,
and perhaps we older ones, are already
inclined to impatience over Cooper, Scott and
Dickens, perhaps because steam and electricity
have keyed us to a faster gait.  Do you not
find boys who will throb over a movie of <i>The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
Last of the Mohicans</i> or <i>The Three Musketeers</i>,
but who can not be induced to wade
through these stories in book form as you and
I so gladly waded?  Is it merely that youth
welcomes the quicker path and that these
same youths will in more mature years turn
to the more leisurely presentation?  Even so,
a slower speed may be losing them as
audience while they are ripening sufficiently
to prefer it.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, do motion-pictures
overfeed us with speed so that we turn with
relief to the more leisurely methods of
fiction?
</p>

<p>
I venture no final conclusion, but certainly
the narrative art as a whole moves faster than
it did twenty or even ten years ago.  Here is
opportunity for some college classes in fiction
or psychology to contribute exceptionally
valuable data through laboratory or field
experiments covering at least a part of the
ground.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile there is no doubt that, by either
old or new standard, most writers would
profit by more condensation.  There is no
surer way of boring a reader than by talking
too much, and even honey or strong drink can
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
be diluted until it has neither strength nor
flavor.  And remember, class-rooms, in judging
this point from published stories, that the
editor has frequently done the writer's
condensing for him because of the story's need
or the limitations of space.
</p>

<p>
<i>Short vs. Long Words and Sentences</i>.—Remember
that in tense moments or under extreme
emotion most men resort to short, simple,
Anglo-Saxon words and brief sentences.
Remember that therefore short words and
sentences are likely to be in themselves more
tense and dramatic and, though not so
generally, more emotional.
</p>

<p>
Remember, too, the need of avoiding
monotony from any word- or sentence-length.
</p>

<p>
<i>Handling, Setting, Color and Character</i>.—Holding
the reader is essentially a matter of
not being dull and there is no sovereign cure
for dullness, but the following device will go
a long way toward avoiding it.
</p>

<p>
Instead of giving the reader setting and
local color in discouragingly large pieces,
weave them into the action.  An old device,
to be sure, but one much too little used.
Instead of describing a vast plain, let a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
character ride over it, speak of it or think of it, thus
at the same time developing scenery, character
and action for the reader.  If you wish to
picture the plain's vegetation, incorporate
some of it as even a very minor plot-factor—have
the rider pluck some of it, have his
horse's progress impeded by it, hide another
character behind it.  There are a thousand
ways of thus accomplishing more than one
thing at once.  But remember, too, that a
reader must be given his general bearings as
soon as he enters a story.
</p>

<p>
<i>Hack Work</i>.—Anything in your story, except
material itself, that has been used until
threadbare by countless writers before you is
"hack stuff" and has small chance of holding
your reader, for the perfectly simply reason
that he's tired of it before he reads it.
Whether a matter of plot or diction and no
matter how good it was in the beginning, it is
a handicap that only a master can turn into
an asset.  Avoid, however, the opposite
extreme of being different to such an extent or
so clumsily that your effort is obvious.  I
know of no recipe for avoiding "hack stuff"—no
more than for avoiding lack of individuality
and other little matters of that kind, but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
surely a writer of even moderate discernment
can detect and correct this fault in some
degree by taking pains to note and avoid the
elements that recur most frequently in poor
or mediocre fiction.  Unfortunately most
writers begin by copying (unconscious copying,
while more ethical, is harder to correct
than is deliberate copying) and your natural
copier is not likely to be overly intelligent in
choice of models.
</p>

<p>
<i>Titles and Chapter Headings</i>.—This subject
is too large for discussion here, since it
involves the psychology of both fiction and
advertising, but three rules can be given: (1)
Aim at the very heart of the subject-matter
for your general title idea; (2) don't let them
betray too much in advance, but make them
"lure"; (3) select chapter heads with almost
as much care as titles, for they are of great
psychological importance.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
PLEASING THE READER
</h3>

<p>
Divide all readers into majority and minority.
It is legitimate and profitable to aim at
either.  Now make your big decision, and it
is a very big one.  At which of these will you
aim?  If the majority, study and analyze their
tastes and reactions.  If the minority, study
and analyze the majority first; then study the
minority.  Their tastes are not necessarily
opposite, but they are necessarily different,
also various; the minority are a unit only in
being different from the majority.  But you
can reach them fairly well merely by giving
them the opposite of what the majority like.
Your problem is whether you can get a better
slice of attention from the majority of
readers in competition with the majority of
writers or from the minority of readers in
competition with a minority of writers.
</p>

<p>
<i>Majority vs. Minority</i>.—Your own peculiar
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
gifts and inclinations in writing should be the
deciding factor, but you can make no intelligent
decision until you really have some
understanding of the two groups between which
you must decide.  If you write for money
only, study them till you have your
human-nature formulas at your finger-ends and
almost automatically apply them to every
idea, expression or bit of material that
comes up for consideration.  If you write for
art only, study them just the same (you'll be
getting the best material in the world), but
instead of turning the results into formulas
turn them into your understanding.  If you
write according to the method—commonly
called inspiration and attributed to what we,
sometimes hastily, term genius—of merely
exploding yourself into the world at large
without deigning to look at said world,
continue to explode as usual, but when your
creation is all created go over it with pencil,
blue-pencil and waste-basket in the light of
knowledge and understanding of whichever
audience you prefer as target, and make very,
very sure that what you inspired into your
story is going to reach that audience just as
you intended it should and is going to please
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
and interest them as much as you fondly
imagined.
</p>

<p>
For, you see, you are almost certainly not
a genius.  A genius makes his own rules and
they are better for his case than are any rules
other people can make for him.  If any genius
is by strange chance reading this book I hope
he will stop and read no other in place of it.
He will almost surely do far better without.
God knows the world is too full of rules for
writing fiction and of people who allow the
rules to ride them out of all ability to use the
rules.  The proper function of rules is that of
mere guides and suggestions to be weighed,
analyzed, and then either discarded or so
thoroughly absorbed that their application
during the act of creating is automatic and
subconscious and their use as tests after
creating is no more than the author's own
spontaneously critical view of what he has
written.  Nothing in this book is intended to
hang like a "Do it now" motto on the author's
wall; its one intention is to give him a fresh
point of view and the kind of foundation that
will enable him to make his own rules out of
his own understanding.
</p>

<p>
In this book we are concerned primarily
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
with the majority of readers and, unless otherwise
specified, have in mind his likings and
reactions.
</p>

<p>
<i>Choice of Material and Theme</i>.—The
majority of readers would probably value their
lives above any other selfish consideration—life
in the sense of existence but also in the
sense of health and vigor.  Next, such things
as love, success, wealth, happiness, uplift,
knowledge, beauty and contest, not necessarily
in the order named.  These, or combinations
of these, such as success in a contest
for life or love or wealth, offer a safe beginning
in selecting material or a theme for fiction.
These are the fundamental things vital
to human beings.  The further you get from
them, the more must you approach appeal to
a minority.  (The majority, of course, does
not always consist of the same individuals,
but merely of most individuals, and shifts in
membership more or less with each shift of
point at issue.)
</p>

<p>
<i>Happiness</i>.—Human beings would on the
whole rather be happy than unhappy.  Therefore
happy themes and pleasant material are
surest for pleasing the majority.  Generally
speaking, people read fiction for entertainment
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
and prefer feeling happier rather than
unhappier when they lay down a story.
Sympathy, morbidness and a desire to play
with the fire of fear, horror and suffering
give rise to contrary tastes in fiction, the
drama and other forms of art, but the
general, fundamental desire is for happiness.
</p>

<p>
What is happiness?  I attempt no definition.
One man knows probably as well as any
other.  All of us can watch other human beings
and have a very fair idea of what makes
most of them happy.
</p>

<p>
Generalizations on human nature are unsafe
but, to take an extreme case, a story of
cripples, deformities and disease, unless this
material is very strongly counteracted with
success, love, sympathy, etc., would please
none but abnormal readers.  Deformities
and disease offend the inherent love of life,
health and beauty.  Again, the majority prefer
non-tragic stories, preferring to think of
life rather than death, of success rather than
unsuccess.
</p>

<p>
Let me make it emphatically plain that I
am attempting no such foolish thing as a catalogue
of material for fiction.  My one purpose
is to lead the writer into doing what he so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
often fails to do—<i>consider his material very
carefully from the point of view of the
probable reactions of human beings instead of
choosing it according to God knows what silly
rules for writing fiction or merely repeating
the material and themes he has seen that
other writers use.</i>
</p>

<p>
A few stray points may be of some service:
</p>

<p>
The beginners and the very young are as a
class the writers most given to tragedy and
morbidness.  As they develop they generally
change to more cheerful material.
</p>

<p>
The percentage of tragic and morbid stories
would dwindle rapidly if it were not for the
empty writer's desire to "do something
strong" and his inability to get strength in
any other way.
</p>

<p>
The horror story has its legitimate place,
as has any story dealing with human emotions,
which are the very heart-food of fiction
and of unfailing interest to the human readers.
Suffering, unsuccess, death, all the
unpleasant things you please, are good fiction
material.  But, if I may make the distinction,
they are good, not because they hurt, but because,
like happier things, they appeal to the
readers' human sympathy and understanding.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
</p>

<p>
Since I shall not give it space anywhere
else, the question of realism <i>versus</i> idealism
may be dragged in here from the point of
view of the readers' liking.  When I first
came to New York, in youthful throes over
this and similar momentous questions, I had
the good fortune of a letter to William Dean
Howells and, trembling at this God-given
opportunity, broached my chief problem.
Mr. Howells was incapable of anything but
gentleness, and the process of his gentleness in
my case was so kindly that its words are no
longer clear in my memory, but the gist of his
reply is very clear indeed.  He told me to go
ride on a Fifth Avenue bus and write down
whatever caught the attention of a young man
fresh to New York.  I pass on to others that
very excellent advice.  Go ride on a bus or
sit still somewhere and write about whatever
catches your attention.  The question of
whether the result is realism or idealism is
one you can afford to forget, for the main
point is that you should follow your own
particular gift for seeing life.  The only attention
you need give the result is consideration of
its appeal to people in general, changing or
not changing the result according to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
relative value you assign to popularity and art,
remembering that the two need not be mutually
exclusive goals and that either realism
or idealism finds response in a sufficient
number of readers.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Philosophy of Fiction</i>.—Doubtless
there are a hundred explanations of the
fundamental appeal of fiction to human beings.
That given by George Henry Lewes seems
particularly illuminating and practically
helpful.
</p>

<p>
It is, in substance, as I recollect it:
</p>

<p>
<i>Fiction appeals to man because it enables
him to attain vicariously, through the characters
in the story world, the perfection and success
he can not attain in real life, and to live
for a while in a world of his own choosing
instead of in the real world that has been
thrust upon him.</i>
</p>

<p>
The first part of this definition does not
seem to apply to realistic and analytical
fiction, though the second part does, nor does
any of the definition seem to take sufficient
account of the reader's enjoyment of the
exercise of his sympathies or the broadening of
his understanding and knowledge or of his
sheer joy in artistic excellence.  This
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
apparent failure to cover the ground, however, is
not so real as it seems.  Joy over artistic
excellence is essentially a critic's feeling, not a
reader's—the joy of a technician, not of a
recipient, of a cook, not of a diner.  And if
you will apply my distinction between fiction
and the various things for which fiction is a
mere vehicle, the contributions to understanding
and knowledge are not a part of fiction
itself and therefore need not be covered by
the definition.  The exercise of the reader's
sympathies may also be accounted for by
strict application of this distinction; or the
"vicarious perfection and success" of the
definition may be broadened to a comparison of
the reader's own life with lives of the story
people, better here, worse there, either
stimulating variety and satisfaction or affording
the vicarious improvement of condition.
</p>

<p>
But, whether or not you consider the definition
all inclusive, there is in it a fundamental
idea whose practical application would go far
toward winning for most writers a far stronger
and deeper hold on readers.  Sophomoric
critics and writers may be inclined to sweep
it off the boards, since it both deals with
fundamentals and undermines some habitual
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
angles of criticism, but most submitted
manuscripts and perhaps most published fiction
would be much stronger if the writers thereof
had made intelligent application of an intelligent
understanding of this principle.  Perfection
and success have in them the element of
completeness, and completeness is a fundamental
desire of the human being, partly because
of the pleasant restfulness of its
attainment.
</p>

<p>
I do not say that every story should reek
with success and perfection, but I do say that
before you even partly eliminate these
factors you should have an intelligent
understanding of what you are doing and should
sacrifice them only for such other factors or
elements as you are sure will more than
compensate in the particular case.
</p>

<p>
Also I say, without hesitation or qualification,
that, in the type of story containing little
or no fundamental appeal other than a march
of events and the success of a more or less
perfect hero or heroine (the type that
includes the large majority of submitted
manuscripts) the application of this principle
means an incalculable increase in effectiveness.
In other words, if the presentation of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
success and perfection constitutes a fundamental
appeal to readers, see to it that you
give these things in rich measure unless you
compensate fully for their absence or partial
absence.
</p>

<p>
Note that these elements are given lavishly
in the "dime-novel" type of story.  This is
probably the lowest type of all (not because
of the superabundance of action, but because
of unnaturalness and all-round poor
workmanship), yet its audience is huge and its
hold on them tremendous.  And if you think
this audience is limited to the unsophisticated
and the very young, you are vastly mistaken;
that hold is too fundamental for a majority
of even our cultured classes to escape from
if it is given fair opportunity.  To advance
exciting and abundant action as the sole
cause for this hold, as is commonly done, does
not sufficiently account for it.  The proof is
that practically none of these stories is
willing to trust to action alone for popularity.
They almost always include another factor.
And that factor is the double one of the
success and perfection of the hero.  The authors
of such stories may include this factor only
because they have seen others do so and may
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
not analyze beyond "people like it," but in
that analysis they are thinking straighter and
truer than are most of the learned and scholarly
exponents and critics of the writing art
who lose themselves, their goal and their
followers in a maze of artificial regulations and
meaningless formalities.
</p>

<p>
<i>Reality</i>.—To preserve balance, let us leap to
the opposite point of view and review in our
minds what was said in the chapter on
convincingness.  For the reader's pleasure in
vicarious success and perfection to have
soundness and stability, or for any other
fiction purpose I can conceive, the story world
must be a reproduction of our real world or
of a modified real world consistent within
itself.  Part of a reader's fiction enjoyment
lies in his familiarity with things presented,
in finding things in their proper place, in the
vanity of "I know that already."  That a hero
should attain remarkably complete success is
acceptable to our reason because such success
is frequently attained in real life.  But a hero
made remarkably perfect in all respects is
likely to be too much for our common sense
and to break the story's hold on us.  "There
ain't no such animile;" we know it, and,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
however much the joys of vicarious perfection
may lure us along through the story, the
illusion is seriously weakened.
</p>

<p>
The obvious remedy is a balanced middle
course.
</p>

<p>
<i>Giving Characters Strong Appeal</i>.—In
following this middle course the need in fiction
to-day, aside from the dime-novel type, is
more emphasis on the perfection element,
not less.  (Incidentally, it would help characterize
a hero, and an appalling percentage of
submitted manuscripts <i>lack even that
amount of characterization</i>.)  Give your hero
or heroine sufficient faults and weak points
to make him as human and fallible as you
please, but give him also the strong elemental
appeal of being close to the limit of human
perfection in one or two traits of character,
or physical or mental characteristics, or along
one or possibly two lines of ability.  Unless,
of course, you are fully prepared to counteract
the loss of this valuable asset with other
elements.  A sadly large proportion of
would-be writers are not thus prepared, and
many a story by a skilled author could have
been improved by an understanding use of
this element.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
</p>

<p>
The same principles apply in less degree
to minor characters.  Villains, of course, aim
at perfection in evil and their success generally
must cease at whatever point will render
the hero's success most effective, but in their
case the conflict between naturalness and
success-perfection is often easily avoided by
the simple and effective device of giving your
villain a quite human allowance of commendable
or pleasing perfections, leaving the
net villain-product as evil as you please—the
engaging villain, the fascinating rascal,
the merely human trouble-maker.
</p>

<p>
The usual fundamental compensation for
a story's lack of perfection and success appeal
is the appeal to the reader's sympathy with
elements similar to those in himself or his
life, including the appeal to his sympathy for
those suffering or enjoying as he has done.
Personally I'm rather inclined to believe the
substitute not quite so effective, the other
appeal seeming the more elemental and
therefore the stronger of the two.  Lewes'
definition can be made sufficiently inclusive
if we say that fiction's hold is due to its
enabling the human being to live life vicariously,
at his own pleasure, on his own initiative
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
and always as the ultimate controller of
destiny, since he can at any moment toss the
story aside, wiping out the entire story world.
But if this is so, isn't it safe to say that the
normal human being on the whole prefers
pleasure to pain and finds more pleasure in
success and perfection than in failure and
imperfection?  Psychologists can justly
retort with, "But what are pleasure and
pain?"  The common-sense answer to that is that the
psychologists can't agree among themselves
upon a definition, that fiction is not written
for psychologists but for people in general,
and that most of us have a sufficiently definite
idea of what pleases people in general and
what is disagreeable to them.
</p>

<p>
When you come to the chapter on "Character"
consider in connection with some of
the points suggested there the points here
suggested as to perfection of hero.  Both
there and here it might pay to run over in
your mind the story characters that have best
stood the test of ages, from "Achilles,"
"Ulysses" and the faithful "Achates" up to modern
times.  Best of all, forget you are a writer and
as a reader shake yourself free for a few
moments from all book learning and culture, all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
preconceived ideas, all opinions of all critics
and very particularly free from self-deception.
Reduce yourself thus to a plain, common
or garden human being, open to any
natural impulses or likings and honestly
willing to recognize and confess them.  Then
pick out the heroes or heroines you most
enjoy, that have the strongest hold on your
liking, being careful not to test by the literary
criteria that have been imposed on you.  If
you do this honestly and keenly you may not
wholly agree with my point of view, but I'll
venture you'll consider your time well spent
and that your allegiance to various learned
dicta may be somewhat shaken.  Particularly
if you habitually identify yourself with the
heroes as you read, don't you find yourself
reveling in a hero's superior wit, grace,
comeliness, strength or skill?  Isn't this proud joy
in him something deeper and more abiding
than tests imposed by sophistication?  Be
honest.
</p>

<p>
To get at the whole matter from a different
angle, don't human beings like to idealize?
</p>

<p>
One other point.  When the world was
young the individual rose or fell, lived or
died, in accordance with the degree of his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
physical strength, skill, courage and beauty.
Mental and moral values were later factors.
The physical is the most elemental, the most
deeply rooted, in the race.  Also, so long as
we have wars and policemen, it remains the
strongest, the court of last appeal.  A
thousand years from now it may have sunk into
comparative oblivion, but even then the racial
instinct of respect and admiration for it
will persist.  If you doubt its greater hold on
human beings at large, forget books and
study people—not just one class or type but
people in general.  No, I am not a materialist;
the moral or mental can overcome the
physical, but it is the physical that is there
first, that is the more elemental in matters of
liking and disliking, the strongest in natural
impulse.  And what I am trying to drive
home is the need of greater consideration of
the elemental likes and dislikes of readers,
for they are being forgotten under the more
vocal and visible likes and dislikes imposed
by a civilization and culture often artificial
and therefore weaker.
</p>

<p>
Why not, then, whenever you can do so
without sacrifice of values more important to
the particular case (as you generally can),
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
see to it that your hero makes this fundamental
appeal in some way?
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, remember the facts of
life.  Listen to the following from William
Ashley Anderson, a writer who, though an
American, fought through the British East
African campaign and has spent a good
many of his years in meeting life in the raw
at far corners of the world as well as life in
its softer centers:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
"Villains who always look like monsters
strike me as burlesque.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Villainous-looking men are frequently
good-hearted and heroic.  Good-looking men
may be fiends.  Character is really indicated
more by expression than features—and a
clever villain can control his expression.
Primitive types, of course, betray themselves
most easily.  The expression of the most
cruel men is usually dull, stupid, hungry—or
with a look of wildness or concentration in
the eyes.  A good man, drunk, may become
an arch-villain.  His looks then might be the
looks of an arch-villain; sober, he might have
the appearance of an angel.  'Lucifer was the
most beautiful of all the angels'!
</p>

<p class="quote">
"By the same token the employment of
handsome, powerful heroes is often
exasperating.  On the average, handsome men are
less likely to be brave than homely men—because
of the very fact that they are handsome;
and a man with pretty features seldom
has a strong character (since the character is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
often spoiled by too much praise in youth, or
too much flattery from women after reaching
adolescence).  You remember Cæsar's
encounter with Pompey, when the former
instructed his hard-bitten veterans to strike at
the faces of the handsome soldiers of
Pompey.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"It is a fact that a man conscious of a handsome
set of teeth recoils more at the thought
of losing several of them from a blow than
he does at the idea of broken limbs."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<i>Poor Heroes, Heroines and Villains</i>.—By
all means do not idealize into such perfection
and success that your characters are unhuman
and unconvincing, but, I implore you, in
making them human do not add any recruits
to the great army of main characters who are
unintentionally presented as imbecile.
Sometimes carelessness is responsible for this
stupidity, but generally the cause is the
writer's surrender to the difficulties of plot—it
is so easy to keep the plot machinery clanking
along by having the hero become a temporary
idiot.  Misunderstanding may be the
basis of tragedy and drama, but a man can
misunderstand without qualifying for an
asylum for the feeble-minded.
</p>

<p>
Please also lend your efforts to the needed
work of abolishing the heroine, supposed to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
be all that is most worth striving for, who is
really empty of everything except vanity, false
pride, cruelty and sublime selfishness—who,
at her worst, offers her hand to the winner
of a contest or the performer of some feat.
I wish some one would organize a writers'
league whose members were pledged either
not to let their heroes leap into the arena at
her bidding or to have them, after recovering
her glove, throw it in her face.  But I fear she
will continue to hold sway undetected, as she
does in real life.  Perhaps the heroes are as
bad, but I am a man myself.
</p>

<p>
<i>Moral Values</i>.—Nearly all people are
moral to the extent of preferring good to bad
when they have nothing at stake, as, for
example, when reacting to merely imaginary
people in a story.  They side with the hero
against the villain.
</p>

<p>
Readers with a discriminating sense of
moral values are likely to be alienated by a
character, supposed to be good, who is made
to act contrary to good morals or ethics by
the apparently unconscious author.  Readers
without this discriminating sense are a moral
responsibility laid upon the author; he is
culpable if he still further befogs their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
discrimination between right and wrong by
winning their approval of a character and then
letting that character seduce them unawares
into bad ethics.
</p>

<p>
Fiction is more than a reflection of the
times; it is a builder of its contemporaneous
thought and morality.  If I were asked to
name the five greatest influences upon the
character of a people I should most
emphatically include fiction and it would be
nearer first than last among the five.  Watch
its effect upon your child.  If you are of
analytical turn, seek far back in memory for the
origin of your own ethical standards and
ideals, or for the influences that strengthened
or weakened them.  Watch the mass of people
respond to the standards held up by
fiction—and by the drama, motion-pictures and
other forms of art.  Do not swallow the
excuse that they "only give what the people
demand"; those of you on the "inside" will
know better.
</p>

<p>
I know the defenses offered for the picaresque
story.  I am familiar with the plea of
"art for art's sake."  It seems to me mere idle
talk.  Art is for life, not life for art, and if
art, however justified by its own laws,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
pollutes the soul of a people, then the cause of
that pollution should be wiped out.
</p>

<p>
Realism and the spread of knowledge can
justify a picture of life as it is, though too
often the author's real interest is not in the
reality of what he presents but in its ugliness.
An author is justified in using fiction as an
instrument against what he sincerely believes
mistaken morality, though his own morality
is impeached if he ventures his dissent without
most anxious consideration of the seriousness
of what he is doing.  But there is no
excuse whatever for presenting ugliness as
beauty, crime dressed in honor, vice as
admirable, crookedness as amusing, rottenness
as normal, evil as good.  He who makes a
criminal a hero is playing with hell-fire, if I
may use so old-fashioned a metaphor.  He who
writes a story of crime triumphant is a
debaucher of public morals.  He who presents,
however bedecked and disguised, a parasite,
a fop, a hypocrite, a brute, a crook, as admirable
is a dry-rot in the heart of the people.  He
who fills his stories with sex, not for the
purposes of honest realism but for the sake of
sex-exciting more nickels from human beings,
is far lower and less courageous than the pimp.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
</p>

<p>
I can not ask you to accept my point of
view in these matters, yet, because of the
broadcast, invidious evil involved and
because the morality of fiction seems a thing
seldom touched upon by text-books, I do ask
that you weigh your responsibilities.  A
surprising number of offenses are purely
inadvertent and are eagerly corrected by the
authors when pointed out, for most writers
are not evil in intent.  These slips, at least,
can be more guarded against, for they are
due more to lack of careful weighing than
to lack of a moral sense.  One common and
easily detected lapse is the use of the principle
that the end justifies the means—the
philanthropic criminal, for example, by
emulating whom any one can justify almost
anything he wishes to do.
</p>

<p>
From the purely practical point of view
these things are for the most part irritations
to the discriminating.  Often with the
undiscriminating they add nothing to the story's
effectiveness, though operating in real life
after the story itself is forgotten.  As to the
popular and financial success of polluting
fiction you will notice that the public is
sufficiently sound usually to react eventually,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
especially if given half a chance, against the
very thing it has embraced.
</p>

<p>
<i>Needless Offenses</i>.—Write it down in red
ink that any slur upon any religion that
creeps into your story will cause everything
else to be forgotten by some of your readers
in their indignation over that affront.  And
make up your mind that anything offering
even the most remote possibility of being
twisted into a slur will assuredly be so
twisted.  Protestants, Catholics, Jews,
Scientists, all have representatives with chips
balanced on the edge of their shoulders.
Generally the slur is taken as a deliberate
insult on the part of both author and editor,
often as sure evidence of a systematic
campaign of propaganda.  If the hero happens to
be a minister, priest, rabbi or reader, other
sects accuse you of propaganda in favor of
the particular religion involved.  If the
villain happens to be one of these, then it is
followers of the religion involved who
complain.  More, the villain need be only a
follower of some religion to convict you of
felonious assault upon that religion itself.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, villains generally have no religion
to speak of, but sometimes it is essential
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
to the story's best interests to include them
at least formally in some particular fold.
When it is, do so, taking care to avoid any
faint suggestion of connection between their
villainy and their faith.  The type of mind
that considers the villainy of a single fictional
character an attack on a religion as a whole
can be given consideration only within the
bounds of reason.
</p>

<p>
Readers are sensitive, too, on the subject
of race.  We have a saying in the office that
the only safe villain is an atheist American.
Since 1917 atheist Germans can be used; in
fact, they are being used until the monotony
of it is wearing.  A Swede as villain is taken
by some as sure sign of malignant persecution
of the Swedes, an English hero proves
anti-Irish propaganda, of late even Mexicans and
Spaniards begin to protest against a fellow
countryman's being used as villain, thus
robbing authors of a time-honored resource.
</p>

<p>
Even local pride rallies to the attack if
fiction happens to paint its locality in
unpleasing colors.
</p>

<p>
Write your story according to its just
demands, but avoid needlessly trampling upon
the toes of any of your readers.  Sore toes
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
are not conducive to the imposition of
successful illusions.
</p>

<p>
<i>Positive vs. Negative Plots</i>.—Lack of
consideration of this fundamental question leads
many writers into losing, unconsciously and
often needlessly, one strong, elemental hold
upon the sympathies of their readers.
</p>

<p>
Human beings like a hero better than a
villain.  They enjoy success more than
failure, construction better than destruction.
Consequently they derive more pleasure from
following to success the fortunes of a hero,
with whom they sympathize or identify
themselves, than from following to failure
the fortunes of a villain, who stands always
for the opposition.  Both appeals are strong,
but the point is that the first is essentially the
stronger.
</p>

<p>
Analyze a little further the reader's reactions
to a negative plot.  The villain is the
central character, the course of whose
fortunes forms the thread of the story.  The
reader, of course, knows this from the start.
He knows, too, from experience with fiction,
that this villain is almost surely doomed to
failure and possibly death and that the
interest of the story lies in watching him be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
hunted down, defeat his own ends or get
caught in a net.  A strong interest, assuredly,
but inherently second in strength and lure
to that of a positive plot.  In the first place,
the reader knows that he is going to a funeral,
real or metaphorical.  Some people like that
above all other things, but most do not.
Vengeance is strong in appeal, but at best
vengeance is only an attempted and
inadequate compensation for loss of success or
perfection.  Second, the reader can give only
divided interest and allegiance.  He generally
prefers that right should triumph, so he
arrays his sympathies against the villain, but
fiction experience has firmly fixed in him
the habit of arraying himself with the
central character, in this case the villain.  The
usual result is that his interest has to
straddle—divide; he is at war with himself
throughout the story.  If the villain succeeds,
the reader's moral sense is hurt.  If the
villain fails, the reader's primal sympathy with
the central character of a narrative is hurt.
He can't have an unrestrained good time no
matter what happens.  And his fundamental
purpose in reading fiction is to have a good
time.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
</p>

<p>
Fiction with only positive plots would be
monotonous and the negative plot gives a
needed relief, but when you turn to it
remember you are under the handicap of a
weakened hold upon your readers.
</p>

<p>
<i>Restraint at the Wrong Time</i>.—Have you
ever considered how often the reader is
robbed of his vicarious enjoyment by being
hurried on when he'd really like to stop and
revel or gloat?  For example, take the villain.
After a career of hellish atrocities and
maddening injuries to others, often causing
years of suffering, he is paid back during the
few seconds required to make a quick neat
bullet-hole through his forehead or to plunge
him over a cliff.  I confess myself un-Christian
enough to long for a more proportionate
punishment.  So do all other readers I have
questioned.
</p>

<p>
Take the lost-treasure story for another
bald, extreme example.  After pursuing the
treasure through a whole story of obstacles
and strain you finally get it.  The author tells
you you have it and promptly drops the curtain.
You don't get a chance to run the
doubloons through your fingers, to finger the
jewels, to sit on the bar silver, to review
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
happily all the pleasant things you can do with
it.  Yet if you really found a treasure, in
those first moments of final attainment all
the long struggle for it might become as
nothing and, in looking back, these might be the
moments most vivid and colorful.  Generally
when story people find the treasure they
don't seem to care a hang.  In real life there
would be drunkenness or delirium of joy.
Edwin Lefèvre first called my attention to
this cruelty by authors, vowing to write a
treasure story in which the reader would
have a real chance to gloat.  If he does so, I've
an idea most of us will get particular
enjoyment therefrom.
</p>

<p>
And the love-story.  The monotony of
what is technically and vulgarly known as
"the clinch at the end" is sound reason for
not always carrying the reader quite that far
along the path of true love, and yet, in spite
of all our sophistication, don't most of us
down in our hearts enjoy that satisfying
culmination of the events we've been following
with so much interest?  Wasn't it what we
wished to happen?  Why, then, should we
enjoy leaving before it does happen, carrying
with us only a hint or an inference that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
it would happen at all?  To be sure, we can
imagine the scene to suit each his own
particular fancy instead of having to accept the
author's, and, however individual the story
may have been, the "clinch" is comparatively
a standardized performance with fewer
enticements of novelty, and yet—most human
beings are human beings.
</p>

<p>
The above are crude illustrations, but they
illustrate an important principle in the business
of pleasing a reader.  The usual failure
to take advantage of the opportunity is only
another one of the thousand losses of
advantage resulting from not training writers
to habitual weighing of the reader's
reactions, particularly his elemental reactions.
Proportionate space and emphasis in a story
must be determined primarily by relation to
plot, but the object of plot is interest and if
you can, without much or any loss in general
proportion, give the reader somewhat more
play at this or that point for the natural
reactions he wishes to exercise, why not pleasure
him instead of suppressing him?
</p>

<p>
It is not a question of pleasant <i>versus</i>
unpleasant reactions, but of whatever the
reader happens to feel.  It may be horror or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
some other unhappy emotion for which he
desires more time and space.  The important
thing is to give him what he desires.
</p>

<p>
<i>Talking Down to the Reader</i>.—Naturally
no reader likes it and illusion suffers in
consequence.  Don't be a schoolmaster or an
encyclopedia to him.  If it's necessary to give
him information, weave it gently and
unobtrusively into the story.  Don't tell him things
he is almost sure to know already.  Treat
him as an equal; don't speak down to him
from a superior height.  It seems bad taste,
as well as a loss in effectiveness, to ask a
reader's interest in your characters and then
sneer at them yourself.  If you are asking
him to join you in the sneering, he may prefer
a more kindly and courteous attitude and
be irritated at you and your invitation.
</p>

<p>
<i>General Irritations and a General Recipe</i>.—Most
of the points covered in the last five
chapters have general application to the
reader's likes and dislikes.
</p>

<p>
Note this:
</p>

<p>
On most points bearing on the writing of
fiction, a well-thought-out violation of the
general rule or custom can often increase
effectiveness.  Old methods and formulas,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
however sound as a general rule, lose in
effect through endless repetition.  They have
become usual, have worn down their original
hold, the reader knows what to expect.  Give
him something different and he is grateful.
Merely to be on the lookout for such
opportunities is good for you in that it keeps you
from falling into the hopeless rut of routine
and slavery to rules.
</p>

<p>
<i>First-Person Narratives</i>.—Do readers
prefer them?  I think nobody knows—nor will
know until somebody takes a national census
on the point.  Why not decide the question
solely according to the demands of the
particular story and your own bent of ability,
since readers are divided on the point?
Some are irritated by too much "I" and by a
point of view limited strictly to one angle;
others like the unity and sharp definiteness
of such a point of view and freedom from the
author's God-like ability to know so much
of what goes on in the minds of all the
characters.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fooling the Reader</i>.—Making a fool of a
person is not likely to win his sympathy.
There is a world of difference between
legitimate surprise and deliberately making a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
reader create and live in an illusion and then
showing him he's a fool for having trusted
you to guide him aright.  The story that, at
the very end, proves to have been all a dream
(which the author led the reader into believing
a reality) is an example of this kind of
vaudeville horseplay.
</p>

<p>
<i>Two Setting Appeals</i>.—Some readers get
the greater enjoyment from settings and
material with which they are familiar, others
from those as far removed as possible from
their daily life.  In the first case the appeal
is probably that of realism mixed with the
joys of self-conceit and pride of knowledge,
in the second, probably of novelty and of
the freedom from the imagination-fettering,
homely, routine details that is so characteristic
of most classic and some modern tragedy.
Here again there is no comprehensive
laboratory knowledge, and the reader's reaction
should not be made the deciding factor when
there is any doubt as to the author's
comparative ability or the demands of the
particular story itself.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the "costume" or "doublet
and hose" story, as in some other kinds of
unfamiliar setting, there is also the appeal
of pageantry.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
</p>

<p>
Temporary factors play their part in
influencing readers' reactions.  When the tide of
war fiction began to ebb there was a noticeable
reader reaction toward anything that
would take one's thoughts away from the
Great War.  The magazines suddenly shut
their doors against stories of the war, but the
mere absence of these was not enough: there
arose a noticeable demand for fiction that
would carry one clear out of these modern
times into past eras of greater simplicity and
less wholesale horror.  War itself was not
tabooed, but it must be war of the old-fashioned kind.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
PLOT AND STRUCTURE
</h3>

<p>
Throughout all nature, throughout the
universe so far as we know it, there is a basic
tendency toward unity and growth.  The
tendency is of course present in the human
mind.  That is why the human mind demands
plot and structure in fiction.  In nature's
higher manifestations of plant and animal the
demand for unity progresses into a demand for
organic structure, an assemblage of parts
whose respective offices and limitations are
determined by their relation to the whole and
which therefore, in addition to their intrinsic
value, assume a relative value that <i>outranks
the intrinsic</i>.  Add to the tendencies of unity
and growth a tendency toward limit of
growth, or perfection.  Fiction plot is the
result of these three universal demands, and
bearing them in mind is a sound foundation
from which to consider all problems in
connection with plot.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
</p>

<p>
A similar process of reasoning from
elemental beginnings would, if relentlessly
applied to the laws, traditions and superstitions
of art, do more than anything else to
free it from chaff, artificialities and
misconceptions that have attached themselves to it.
</p>

<p>
There is even advantage in considering
examples from nature for the sake of clearer
understanding of the nature and requirements
of plot.  You already know what plot
is, but see whether comparison with the
following will not crystallize your concept of it
to a degree that will make you largely
independent of rules and regulations:
</p>

<p>
A river-system, a river and its network of
tributaries, is like a plot.  A unity with
growth in a single general direction with its
mouth as climax or limit of growth; many
elements combining smoothly and perfectly
into one.
</p>

<p>
The tap-root and subsidiary roots of many
plants furnish a similar illustration.  A tree's
framework is an inverted example.
</p>

<p>
A rope of vines or, more clearly, a man-made
piece of rope in the process of making
with the loose strands gathered at one end
into a closely knit main line.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
</p>

<p>
A snow-slide forced by the terrain to converge
all its material into a narrow gap at the
foot of the slope.
</p>

<p>
It would be, I think, a pity if all trees and
all river-systems were made in strict accordance
with one pattern, as the rules so largely
demand of plot-building.  Yet either tree or
river-system would be no longer such—and
a sad spectacle indeed—if it were cut into bits,
were large where it should be small or were
otherwise changed from its essential nature.
</p>

<p>
<i>Structure</i>.—It has been said that the short
story is far more exacting than the novel in
demand for strict unification and rigid
enforcement of relative values.  That is true in
practise and I am not sure that it isn't true
in theory.  Perhaps the novel escapes through
mere laziness or inability of writer and
reader to create and receive so large a unit
perfectly constructed in all its many details.
Perhaps, on the other hand, the novel is a
more natural expression by the writer and a
more natural and desired form for the
reader.  Perhaps, if we draw the distinction
between novel and romance, only the latter
should be held to the strict requirements of
short-story structure.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
</p>

<p>
To take the form of strictest requirements,
I have found only one rule that seems in
practise to produce satisfactory results:
</p>

<p>
The short story has one main point and
only one.  It may be the climax of a course of
events, an aspect of life, a psychological
impasse, what you will.  But there must be only
one of it.  Every other element in the story,
every scrap of material, every bit of color,
every human trait, <i>everything</i> in the story,
must be subsidiary to the main point.  No
elements are even admitted to the story
unless they serve in developing the main point.
When admitted they get space and emphasis
only in proportion to that service.  No one
of them is valuable in itself; their values are
wholly relative, not intrinsic.  (Of course,
there is no reason for not abandoning this
principle on occasion if you are <i>sure</i> you can
better satisfy your readers by so doing.)
</p>

<p>
<i>Violations of Unity</i>.—Compelling your
reader to follow alternately two sets of
characters in two sets of scenes is dangerous, since
it violates unity unless the reader is kept
keenly conscious of their inevitable
convergence upon one point.  Hopping back and
forth in the time of the action is in most
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
cases fatal to unity.  Shifting the point of view
is objected to on grounds of violated unity—telling
your story first from the angle from
which events are seen by one character, then
from the angle of another character or from
that of the author.
</p>

<p>
Do not leave loose strands dangling along
your rope, like a minor character who vanishes
without needed explanation, or a line of
endeavor suddenly abandoned without a
word.
</p>

<p>
Too many characters are not only an obstacle
to clearness but greatly increase the
difficulty of unification.
</p>

<p>
Do not attempt to include too much material,
color, life-history or anything else.
If your story refuses to unify satisfactorily
it may be because you are using more
elements than you are able to handle.  Even
if you can handle all you have, be sure that
the expanse of your canvass is not greater
than the reader can look at conveniently and
without missing some of it.  In a general way
it is well to tuck it in at the edges, so to speak,
and enclose it in a fairly definite picture-frame.
</p>

<p>
<i>Holding Reader to Correct Plot Line</i>.—It is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
not sufficient to select and assemble the
proper elements according to their relative
values.  The assignment of proper relative
space and emphasis must be managed with
such nicety that the reader can not mistake
their common direction.  He may be kept
from knowledge of the goal, but he must
know and feel that everything in the story,
carrying him along with it, is sweeping along
in one single general direction.  If he is on a
tributary flowing southwest he must know
that it is a tributary, not the main stream, that
it flows southwest and that the main stream,
while it may flow southwest, south or
south-east, will hardly flow north.
</p>

<p>
A reader tends to anticipate, to cast ahead.
Make sure that, while you hold from him
sufficient to make any desired surprise effective,
he does not waste his attention-strength by
casting ahead over false trails leading away
from your general direction.  In other words,
keep him in hand from start to finish, being
sure his feet follow your path in your direction.
</p>

<p>
To instill a sense of plot, one must either
go into endless rules, exceptions, diagrams
and analyses or else present only the fundamentals
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
and commoner guide-posts, leaving
the writer to develop his own ability.  There
has been too much of the former method and
I shall not attempt to add further initiative-killing
rules, particularly as I believe that the
majority of fiction rules can often be violated
with good results.
</p>

<p>
<i>Non-Conformist Plot and Structure</i>.—No
rule for fiction has a sound basis unless it is
grounded on some such elemental in human
nature as an instinctive desire for growth,
unity, completeness, a rounded-out whole,
symmetry, rhythm, contrast, and so forth.
But even an elemental desire can be led to
the point of temporary satiety, even contrast
itself.  Monotony is undoubtedly monotonous.
</p>

<p>
Consider the reader.  Fed year after year
with the results of the same rules, with the
same literary devices, the same general plots
and endings, the same signs along the way,
isn't his appetite for standard food sure to be
dulled at intervals?  He is far wiser and
more sophisticated in fiction than you probably
think; if he goes right on eating standard
food it is often because he finds a scarcity of
other kinds.  Why not study the condition of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
his appetite, estimating from how much of
certain kinds of food he has had to eat and
for how long, and then make a business of
feeding him a new kind until he tires of it
in turn?  A most unliterary suggestion?
Perhaps, but I should not wholly relish the task
of proving it such.
</p>

<p>
There are, at least, certain fashions in
fiction and even in "literature" that change and
change back with the years.  The costume
story reigns, sinks into oblivion, reigns again.
The author chats himself into his stories,
keeps out of them, enters once more to chat
again.  Romance and realism alternate in
favor.  The critics permit it, though sneering
perhaps at each change, just as they are
inclined to sneer at both change and
permanence themselves.
</p>

<p>
Why not other changes?  For example,
more changes from the rules of plot?  Many
fairly radical changes, indeed, could be made
without violation of the really fundamental
rules.
</p>

<p>
Here is the story of an interesting laboratory
experiment on the reactions of readers.
During the war our managing editor was
stationed in one of the largest officers'
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
training camps.  He made a business of watching
the reactions of his comrades to magazine
fiction and of course to our own magazine in
particular.  It happened that an author asked
me to decide a question for him.  He was
writing a novelette around an historical
character and found himself on the horns of
a dilemma.  Either he must do extreme violence
to the facts of that famous person's life,
particularly as to sequence of events, or else
abandon any attempt at a real fiction plot.
I suggested that he abandon the attempt at
plot and structure and make the story
practically a mere running narrative.
</p>

<p>
In the training camp the results of that
experiment were startling and very suggestive.
Among all the stories in books and magazines
that structureless novelette reported by far
the most comment and praise.  The most
valuable point was that the readers were
sufficiently analytical to know, and state,
exactly why they liked it: "Different from
other stories."  "Couldn't tell what was going
to happen."  "Couldn't predict the end after
reading a third of the way."  "Like real life."
</p>

<p>
Many of them had read numerous other
stories by the same author, Hugh Pendexter,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
dealing with similar material and times, but
all these stories had conformed to the laws
of plot and structure.  Practically none of the
readers was sufficiently familiar with the
historical character's life to know the
material in advance.
</p>

<p>
Another laboratory experiment.  One day
in the office some one suggested we hadn't
had a "desert island" story for a long while
and ought to get one.  All agreed, but of
course with no enthusiasm; all of us could
tell that story in its essentials before it was
even written.  Then some one wished they'd
write "desert island" stories that were
different.  All seven of us fell to outlining the
kind we'd like personally.  All seven agreed.
All wanted the usual "props" left out and
all wanted the castaways to have a real and
a realistic struggle for existence—"no
self-sacrificing fish," as one put it.  There were
to be no practical specialists like engineers,
sailors, carpenters and botanists in the party.
Just every-day people like ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Then we figured that, if this was the kind
of story all of us craved, there were probably
many readers, just as sophisticated or "fed
up" as we, who also would welcome this
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
departure.  We presented the problem to
J. Allan Dunn, asking whether he cared to
write a "desert island" novelette without any
of the usual material therefor, no savages,
volcanoes, women, cocoanuts, socialism, rival
party, tropical vegetation, fierce beasts,
animals waiting for domestication, no specialists
in the party, no supplies to draw from,
nothing, not even a pen-knife or watch-crystal.
Each of us wrote out a list of the things he
knew or could do that might be useful in the
circumstances—unspecialized and, mostly,
meager lists.
</p>

<p>
He accepted, after justified hesitation.
We modified our terms to permit him wild
dogs and wild boars for excitement, meat
and leather, but it was understood that
action, interest and whatever plot proved
possible were to be drawn from the barehanded
struggle with nature for existence.
</p>

<p>
The conditions and circumstances were
given to our readers along with the published
story.  It won a stronger response from them
than had any other story we'd published for
several years.  This from the audience of a
magazine devoted primarily to action stories
of which the usual "desert island" story is a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
fairly representative type, though it must be
admitted that this audience has been
recruited from among those who prefer more
nourishing meat along with the action, insist
upon a sound basis of fact or probability and
are too sophisticated not to have tired of the
usual hack melodrama.
</p>

<p>
These two experiments are at least
suggestive.  You can doubtless recall from your
own experience stories that registered
strongly on you because of variance from the
usual types.  Generally, if the story succeeds,
the variance is attributed to genius or unusual
gifts; as a matter of fact it is in most cases
due either to accident or to a mere common-sense
study of readers and what can be expected
to have dulled their appetites.
</p>

<p>
<i>Ending a Story</i>.—Variance from type in
the ending is of particular value.  It must, of
course, be an ending logically belonging to
the story, but surprise, or at least change, is
entirely possible.
</p>

<p>
Yet is there any escape from the "happy
ever after" ending of a love-story?  I suppose
and hope so, but have my doubts except as
to the rarest instances.  A love-story without
at least the suggestion of marriage or its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
substitute as ending seems considered almost as
desolate as a love-story without either love
or story.  Renunciation is a reversal of
"happy ever after" rather than a variation,
and not generally popular.  Death is very
grudgingly accepted as a substitute.  I've
made earnest effort to secure variants—parties
decide to be friends instead, one party
proves to love a third party or grows weary
of the second, parties quarrel and omit
making up, death of either or of all hands,
anything for a change.  No results except a
death-rate well under one per cent.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it is because writers believe editors
will not accept variants from the "happy
ever after."  I suspect their belief is well
founded, but I wonder whether in this case
the editorial attitude is not solidly based on
a downright insistence from human-being
readers.
</p>

<p>
Unhappy endings?  The minority like
them, the majority do not.  I can venture
nothing more except that the size of the
minority increases if the line is drawn not
between "unhappy" and "happy" but between
endings that leave the reader depressed and
those that leave him uplifted.  Through the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
latter, with their appeal of pathos or high
tragedy, there is decided opportunity for
comparative variation from the usual.
</p>

<p>
At the end of a story I think most readers
rather resent loose strands of plot left untied,
like minor characters of whose future no
glimpse is afforded or some minor enterprise
that has run through the plot only to have its
fate a mystery at the end.  Skill, particularly
in unifying severely to the central point, can
make the reader forget the disappearance of
minor strands at the very end, but it is well
to remember that most readers have a
healthy sense of legitimate curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<i>Beginning a Story</i>.—At the first word of
your story the reader knows nothing concerning
it except what title, illustrations and
contents-page may have told him.  Generally
he doesn't know whether it is laid in Africa,
Alaska or New York City, or whether it is
of to-day, 1890 or 1700.  The more quickly
you tell him, the more quickly can you draw
him into your illusion.  If you wait, you
almost certainly confuse and irritate him.
Story after story comes in to editors that
leaves the reader groping and unable to settle
down until long after it is under way; often
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
he doesn't learn where he is until he has
wandered through several pages.  Even a
paragraph is too long a wait—and waste.
You need not make a business of placarding
date and place, but there are a myriad ways
of introducing him quickly to both.  Failure
to do this is so common and so extremely
injurious to the story's effectiveness that it
affords a most striking example of the disastrous
effects of giving more attention to rules
than to common sense and of not drilling into
the very bones of writers the necessity of
watching and measuring their stories
constantly from the point of view of readers.
</p>

<p>
Another common and bad mistake is to
present any but a main character first,
preferably the main character.  Indeed, in the
short story perfect unification almost
demands that he be first on the stage.  But
there is a common-sense reason aside from
that of unity and centralization.  Long
experience with fiction has taught readers that
the first character to appear is nearly always
the main character, therefore whatever character
gets the initial spot-light is promptly
seized upon by them as the main one.  If
he isn't, they have to let go of the story
illusion they are already building and start
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
building a new one around a new center and
feel rather foolish or cheated and irritated.
As in the case of not setting time and scene,
the writer has failed to hold them to the
correct plot line—even to start them on it.  Of
what avail is knowledge of technique, or the
present method of teaching technique, if it
fails to impress such horse-sense points as
these?  Sufficient skill can introduce the
central character when and how it pleases,
but most writers lack it.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the drama there is no harm
in minor characters appearing first.  Stage
custom has established this, not the other, as
the custom.  Also, the stage, being better able
to study its patrons at first-hand, has realized
the catastrophe of letting them stray from the
correct plot line and guards against it by
giving out programs in advance as keys to caste
(with characters listed in order of appearance),
scene, time and sometimes even more;
the rise of the curtain instantly gives the
audience its bearings in a general way, and
star, scene, time and even plot are frequently
known before entering the theater.  Writers
of fiction could profit tremendously by
careful study of the necessarily practical
technique—or common sense—of the theater.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
CHARACTER
</h3>

<p>
For broadest popularity possibly the prime
single requisite in fiction is action plot, but,
if so, character drawing is at least a close
second.  Human nature's interest in human
nature is undying and intense.  By the tests
of the somewhat indefinite thing we call
literature, character probably ranks first.
Action, on the other hand, seems the more
primitive and the more fundamental; early
man undoubtedly acted first and thought
later; when he learned to analyze his fellows
it was for purposes of action.
</p>

<p>
<i>An Experiment</i>.—It is interesting to look
back over the centuries and consider the
stories that have had sufficient hold to
endure.  Which do you remember first and the
most distinctly, "Sherlock Holmes,"
"Mulvaney," "Richard Feveril," "Amyas Leigh,"
"John Silver," "Becky Sharpe," "Old
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
Scrooge," "Quasimodo," "Don Quixote,"
"Falstaff," "Hamlet," "Lady Macbeth,"
"Faust," etc., or the plots and action in which
they were concerned?  "Arthur," "Tristan,"
"Roland," "Siegfried," "Finn McCool," etc.,
or their adventures?  "Aeneas," "Hector,"
"Ulysses," etc., or what they did?
</p>

<p>
I have made no laboratory tests on other
people, so can risk no conclusions from this
test beyond venturing that, as the race grew
older and its literature developed, character
interest tended to take first place over the
more primitive action appeal.  Make your
own tests, allowing for the differences
between stories of the last few centuries and
those of long ago.  After trying out yourself,
try out as many other people as you can.  If
you do, you'll get valuable knowledge—and
understanding—not likely to be found in
books.
</p>

<p>
You'll get not only some useful fundamental
ideas on the values and relative
values of plot and character, but possibly, by
contrast with others, a sound idea as to
whether your real bent is for plot or for
character, and, best of all, you will have done
something toward forming or strengthening
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
the laboratory habit of examining facts
instead of swallowing at theories, and the habit
of thinking for yourself instead of using the
weakening crutch of accepting other people's
theories that they in turn probably accepted
from other people <i>ad infinitum</i>.
</p>

<p>
In any case character drawing—human
nature—is one of the two most important
elements in fiction.  Yet the lack of it marks
the majority of submitted manuscripts.  In
many of these cases it is an utter, total,
complete, absolute lack, unless you count the
crude class distinction between hero and
villain.  Characters are merely proper names,
lucky if there is even an individualized or
slightly individualized physical body to cling
to, and twice lucky if said body has clothes
or habits of its own.  You can lift them out
of one story and substitute them in another
with no damage to them or to either story
and with decided profit in the case of the
first.  It is pitiful—and maddening.
</p>

<p>
The tragedy of it is that it can easily be
remedied by any writer of average human
intelligence.  All he needs for comparatively
decent characterization is a certain very
simple recipe.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>A Recipe</i>.—I don't know whose recipe it is,
having heard it years ago and forgotten his
name, though I think its accredited father
dates back a century or so, but he should be
crowned in honor and the use of his recipe
made compulsory by law.  Apparently not
one writer in ten thousand ever even heard
of it.
</p>

<p>
You can dig out that recipe for yourself
by the laboratory method advocated above,
if you will trace English literature back
toward its beginnings.  And if I give you a
broad hint by suggesting a bit of thoughtful,
practical consideration of the morality plays,
you should have no trouble at all.
</p>

<p>
There it is, simple, elemental, effective—<i>assign
to each person in your story one single
trait of character and make him show it by
actions, words, thoughts.</i>
</p>

<p>
Carry it into as much detail as possible.
If I remember aright, the recipe's reputed
father took as example a character whose
one trait was cruelty and said that if he were
made to walk in a garden he must be made
to knock off the heads of flowers with his
cane as he passed.
</p>

<p>
That's as far as the recipe goes, so far as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
I remember, but try a second elementary
step—show the reaction of this single
predominant trait upon the other persons in the
story, in what they say to him, do to him,
think of him, always, of course, in the light
of their own single traits.
</p>

<p>
Third step: Assign one or more persons
a second trait, a minor trait, and proceed as
before.
</p>

<p>
Try it, if you are not beyond the need of
fundamental suggestions as to characterization.
You will not only reap a rich harvest
of concrete results but will also be getting a
most excellent training.
</p>

<p>
Only a few days ago I was told of a case
in which it has had a thorough test.  I've
never read anything by the author in question,
but know that he turns out a consistent
and steady flow of books whose sales are
enormous though treated with condescension
by critics of literature.  The report is that in
the actual writing of his stories he does not
even give names to his characters but uses
the name of the predominant traits he
assigns to them—Cruelty, Honesty, Vanity, and
so on.  When the story is finished he, or
perhaps his secretary, goes through the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
manuscript, strikes out these names of traits and
gives each character whatever name meets
general requirements.  <i>Voilà</i>!  Personally,
I'd give a good deal to know what would happen
to his sales if he abandoned this method
and the kind of characterization it
produces—to know, rather, whether he would ever
have had enormous sales if he had not used
this recipe.
</p>

<p>
Just using the morality plays—and <i>Pilgrim's
Progress</i>—as a sound foundation.
Maybe it's funny, but maybe you could profit
by it yourself.  Heaven knows that plenty of
writers could!
</p>

<p>
<i>Tags</i>.—If I could, I'd hang over almost
every writer's desk a large card bearing in
very black letters these words:
</p>

<p>
"Remember that yours is not the only story
in the world and that it has to compete for
the reader's attention with countless other
stories.  Your interest in it is particularized
and personal; his is not.  Also, you already
know everything in the story; he does not.
You may have failed to put on paper part of
what you know; in that case he will never
know it.
</p>

<p>
"Remember that your reader has met many
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
people in real life, forgotten all about most
of them, including their names, and that in
the great number of stories he has read he
has met a far greater number of fictitious
people who, along with their names, fail in
even greater proportion than have the real
people to register upon his attention, interest
and memory.  You are merely adding a few
more to his hundreds of thousands.  The
competition is heavy.  You can make no
headway against it if your story-persons are
only names, almost none if they are only
mildly individualized and characterized,
little enough even, if they are drawn fairly
strongly.
</p>

<p>
"Remember, too, that when you introduce
him to more than two or three new people
they have to compete, also, among
themselves—that he is likely to have difficulty
even in straightening them out in his mind
and connecting the right name with each
character.  If you wish your people to get
and hold his attention and to have any place
in his memory, you must strive with all your
might to <i>mark</i> each character, to individualize
each character, by every means within
your reach.  If you have not a natural gift
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
for character drawing, use elementary
methods."
</p>

<p>
The particular elementary, and very
effective, method I have in mind is to hang on
to each character one or more of what in the
writing of plays are called, I believe, tags.
It can be called, if you like, advertising your
characters.  Most of them need it.  Or
might be likened to the use of motifs in
opera.  Or you might find in it even an
approximation to the conditions of real life.
</p>

<p>
Put a strongly individualized label on each
of your characters and make the readers keep
looking at it.  This character continually
introduces his speeches with "Well now"; that
one is always nervously hitching up his
trousers at the knees; John Jones is so
interested in golf that he is perpetually dragging
it into conversation; Myrtle is always tittering;
Brown is conspicuously careful of his
personal appearance, while his brother
George wears anything that comes handy and
Sister Isabel has almost a monomania for
red; Judson habitually looks into the eyes of
people with an intent gaze that is hard to
meet; Henry in appearance and manner
suggests a sheep; the peculiar blackness of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
Maude's eyes is her most marked and
impressive feature.
</p>

<p>
Never let a character remain long on the
stage without presenting his tag.  It
individualizes more strongly than a name.  It is a
most useful guide-post to the reader.  It
strongly reinforces character-drawing and
may even serve as a cheap substitute, a
substitute at any price being preferable to
nothing.  Also, it becomes an <i>asset in itself</i>, an
element of appeal that runs the range from
farce to tragedy and you can mix or alternate
these or other appeals with strong results.
Its effect is cumulative.  There is for its
intrinsic value a sound grounding in
fundamental human nature—a reader's unconscious
pride and vanity in "detecting" it as
characteristic, in being able to forecast its
coming, his interest and consequent like or
dislike for tags in real life, his comfort in
having mental tasks made easy.
</p>

<p>
Of course, if you've drawn real character
for the persons in your story, make their tags
consistent with character—or, rarely, in
deliberate and evident contrast.  Equally, of
course, a tag, like any other good thing, must
be handled with judgment and not allowed to
run riot.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Results from Tags and High-Point
Characterization</i>.—Study the following fiction
characters that have made a big and lasting "hit,"
so much so that they have been carried
through a series of books: "Sherlock
Holmes," "Captain Kettle," "Don Q.,"
"Brigadier Gerard," "Tartarin," "D'Artagnan,"
"Athos," "Porthos," "Aramis," "Mulvaney,"
"Ortheris," "Learoyd," "Allen Quatermain,"
"Wallingford"; consider also some
characters of Dickens.  Some of these are
well-drawn and well rounded out, but others
reduce to the bare bones of the "one-trait
recipe" and the use of tags, really very
elementary creations.  Yet all are made vivid
and individualized by means of tags and
strongly emphasized traits of character.
While the tags, for the most part, are handled
with at least a fair degree of skill, the
characterization in some cases, though of course
not limited to a single trait, is incomplete,
very elementary and not very well done.  Yet
all have gained a strong popular success, not
just from the stories in which they appear,
but as characters.
</p>

<p>
It is clear from the above that while the
"one-trait recipe" and the use of tags do not
necessarily spell literature they are by no
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
means incompatible with it.  They are merely
first steps toward really good character
depiction.  Their importance in any teaching of
fiction is due chiefly to the lamentable fact that
most writers do not take or even see them.
</p>

<p>
Even advanced writers can often profit
from consideration of their values.  For
example, in a certain successful series of
novelettes and novels told in the first person but
centering on another character, the narrator
was almost entirely lacking in tags and
salient character traits and didn't even have
a name, or a past, or a body, or, often, clothes
until well along in the series.  He was
consistently drawn, so far as he went, but almost
colorless and with little grip on interest and
memory, though having a prominent place in
the plot and not thus subordinated for the
sake of relative values and unity around the
central character.  The central character was
strongly drawn, tags and all, and the series as
a whole had so many other merits that the
colorlessness of the fictitious narrator could
not wreck it, but its improvement was very
marked when he was developed and brought
to his proper place in the lime-light by the
tags and salient traits needed in addition to
the general filling in.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Characterization in General</i>.—I attempt no
covering of the subject, desiring only to bring
out the points that the general in-flow of
manuscripts shows are, in practise, most in
need of attention.  There are already hosts
of books giving detailed instructions,
theories, examples, analyses and exercises.
Some of them are useful and valuable in
many cases.  In general they seem to me
likely to be dangerous, unless the student
uses exceptional care, in that they are likely
to encourage a tendency toward mechanics
instead of art, artificiality instead of
naturalness, strain and limitation instead of
freedom, and copying instead of art.  I am aware
that tags and the "one-trait recipe" seem
open to the same charge, but their saving
clause is that they can teach the writer how
to develop himself rather than how to turn
out finished work by rule.  Also the present
need of them in practise is appalling, and
perhaps that need would not be so great if
writers had been trained by more naturalistic
methods.
</p>

<p>
The only sound and comprehensive rule for
characterization is:
</p>

<p>
Study people, first as subjects, second as
recipients of the knowledge you have gained.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
INDIVIDUALITY VS. TECHNIQUE
</h3>

<p>
Year after year editors sit at their desks
and almost at a single glance reject anywhere
from sixty to ninety per cent. of the
manuscripts that come in, and, on the whole, they
make few mistakes in so doing.  Some of
these summarily rejected ones are so illiterate
that most freshmen in college would
unhesitatingly turn them down, but on the
majority is the damning and almost unmistakable
brand of "no individuality"—merely
another manuscript plodding blindly along
in the machine-like effort to turn out by
machine-like methods another one "like
those they've read," another stilted, unnatural
attempt at producing a life-like copy of
a model denaturalized, by them or their
teachers, into a mechanical and artificial
collection of rags, bones and hanks of hair that
has never known the breath of life.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Lack of Individuality</i>.—How can the editor
tell at a glance?  How in heaven's name can
he help telling?  He's read the same kind of
thing—the same thing except for variations
of theme and setting—thousands and thousands
and thousands of times before until
recognizing it at a glance is as easy as
recognizing a trolley-car among other vehicles on
his way to the office of mornings.  The tracks
are no plainer in one case than the other.
</p>

<p>
But maybe the author does better farther
on in the story?  Doubtless it has happened,
but the instances constitute a negligible
factor.  That poor editor learned to hunt no
farther only by hunting farther thousands of
times, when he was new and optimistic, and
finding nothing.  He has learned that any
writer fool enough to begin a story in so
stupid a way is too much a fool all the way
along to be worth listening to.
</p>

<p>
Disbelieve this ability, if you like, and let's
pass on to the stories he does not discard at
a glance.  These he reads to varying extents,
according to their ability to hold him as an
editor—sometimes a cursory examination,
sometimes solid parts here and there,
sometimes straight through, sometimes only part
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
way.  Many things, including mistaken judgment,
can stop him, but oftenest of all I believe
it is the story's lack of individuality.
He finds he's read it too many times before
and knows that his readers have.
</p>

<p>
The sameness may be in plot, theme, style,
anything or all together, but it's the sameness
that stops him and kills the story.  As a
reader, judge for yourself from the stories
that get published, after editors have
discarded all but enough to fill their space—all
but one to five per cent. say, of the total
submitted.  Is there not sufficient sameness
in even these?  Then judge what the discarded
ninety-five or ninety-nine per cent. must
be, making any reasonable allowance
you please for the fallibility of editors.
</p>

<p>
<i>Reasons for the Lack</i>.—Much of the lack
of individuality in stories is due to lack of
individuality in the writers.  To what degree
a person can develop his individuality I do
not presume to say, but lack of real individuality
in his stories is curable to exactly that
degree and no more.
</p>

<p>
But many of the writers whose stories show
none, have individuality.  Why doesn't it
show in their work?  Because they have been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
taught by present methods of teaching fiction
to be artificial, not natural, or have
themselves slavishly modeled themselves
after some one else.
</p>

<p>
What chance has your individuality if you
turn your back on it and resolutely try to
copy another man's, or if you lose yourself in
an endless maze of rules and regulations?
Rules and regulations imposed, for the most
part, by people equally lost in the maze.
</p>

<p>
No, you can't let your individuality run
riot regardless of all rules, for some rules are
laws of the human mind to which all of us
are subject.  But it does not follow that you
must assassinate your individuality.  It is
your main asset.  Without it, neither empty
rules nor sound laws can build anything of
themselves.
</p>

<p>
Technique?  Of course you need technique,
but if you make of it a golden calf and bow
down in worship, you perish.
</p>

<p>
Get technique; don't let it get you.  What
technique should give you is tools, not rules.
And not a monomaniac collector's collection
of tools, collected for the sake of including all
tools known to man, but only those tools so
well mastered that they fit almost
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
automatically into your hand, carrying out smoothly
the guiding impulse of your brain.
</p>

<p>
But you have to learn to use them before
you can acquire such skill?  Yes, but remember
the purpose of your learning—and don't
try to learn and use more tools than you can
master.  Remember that an augur is an
augur—that it's not a demand upon you to
bore a hole in something, but only a means
of making a hole when one is needed.  Because
a hammer is for driving nails do you
have to use it when you're modeling in clay?
</p>

<p>
I dare say it is bad taste for me to criticize
other books on writing fiction and other
methods of teaching fiction, but, pardon me,
I don't give a damn.  For years I've sat and
watched teachers, poorly equipped for the
task and perfectly equipped for their manner
of handling it, blandly do their utmost to ruin
a writer by holding before his wide eyes so
many rules that he finds it difficult ever to
see anything else.  If among them are included
some rules on preserving his individuality
while he's following all the other rules,
what can that mean to him?  If his teachers
perchance present technique as tools, not
rules, they load so many of them upon his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
trustful back that he can not walk, to say
nothing of mastering the tools.
</p>

<p>
The essence of their damage lies in two
things:
</p>

<p>
First, the rules they pour forth so endlessly
they themselves got from some one else and
accept them chiefly for that reason.  Ask
them the why of each of their rules and there
is likely to be a considerable hiatus between
their last book and the next.
</p>

<p>
Too often they seem to have been merely
perpetuating an hereditary collection of rules
for the sake of preserving the collection as an
entity in itself, forgetting that some of the
rules might be unsound and neglecting—if
they ever thought about them—to give their
students the foundations in human nature
upon which the sound ones must rest.
</p>

<p>
Second, the whole tendency of such teaching
is to make the learner look at other writers
instead of within himself, to absorb other
people's style and methods instead of
developing his own, to copy rather than to think
things out for himself, to be artificial rather
than natural, cramped rather than free, to
waste his time on details instead of giving it
to vital things.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
</p>

<p>
I should venture no such strong condemnation
if I did not feel that I am merely voicing
the opinion of most editors—of the men and
women who are in best position to note the
devastating effects upon to-day's fiction.  And
I am, of course, speaking of the books and
teaching methods as a class.  There are
exceptions, naturally—though one writer, for
example, tells me he has read between forty
and fifty books on fiction writing, finding
only one of them worth while—and practically
all such books can be of use, sometimes
of very great use, to the raw beginner.  So can
a rhetoric or a common English grammar.
</p>

<p>
In the light of results, the fundamental
point these books most fail to make is that
most of their contents should be read—not
memorized or swallowed—for stimulus and
suggestion only, and that the student must see
to it that no rules turn him aside from his
main business of developing and using his
own individuality.
</p>

<p>
I am painfully aware that in this book I,
too, have given rules as rules, but I have tried
to give the foundations of a sufficient number
of them to lead the student into the habit of
looking for foundations himself and working
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
out his own destiny.  For the foundations I
ask consideration, for my rules none at all
except as danger-signs erected from twenty
years' experience to point out the errors most
common in actual practise.
</p>

<p>
I am still more keenly aware that in many
instances I fail to meet possible objections and
justified exceptions.  Often it is because I fail
to think of them at the time or never thought
of them, but often it is because there is a limit
to available space and because too many
aspects and too much detail breed confusion.
Literature is the communication, between
human beings, of human nature and human
experience.  Who can give complete rules for
a process and content so infinitely various?
Bear in mind first, last and always, that this
book does not attempt to be a complete
treatise on writing fiction.  Its purpose is to
emphasize those points and points of view
that, from years of examining the actual
manuscripts submitted to magazines, seem
most to need emphasis, and, second, to raise
against the present fashion in teaching
methods a small flag of revolt under which I
believe most editors and most discriminating
readers will be content to stand, no matter
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
how great may be their disagreement with
me on specific points.
</p>

<p>
<i>Unfamiliarity with Things Taught</i>.—Last
week I borrowed three books on the writing
of fiction and ran through their pages.  One
was by a university professor who gave a
most interesting picture of the editorial world,
of its offices, their occupants, customs, rules,
policies, points of view.  The title-page stated
that he had formerly been with a publishing
house—probably for the sake of the experience,
during a summer vacation.  I became
fascinated, almost wishing I could live in that
world myself.  I never have.
</p>

<p>
I realize that, for those entirely unfamiliar
with the inside of the editorial world, his
picture of it was sufficiently near the truth to be
of decided practical value.  Yet his almost
glib generalities and his choices for
particularization made me shudder for the
misapprehensions that might arise from them.  He
was like the European traveler who spends a
month or two in the United States and then
describes and explains it to the world.  Any
conscientious editor of long experience would,
I think, hesitate before attempting to present
in a chapter or two of a text-book for earnest
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
students a complete and final exposition of
the editorial field.  It is too complex, too
various, too changeable.
</p>

<p>
And if these teachers venture to expound
so much and so finally from so small a knowledge
of what may be called the mere machinery
of the editorial world, it seems logical to
conclude that they may have equally
insufficient basis when they attempt to explain
what kind of fiction the editors want and
how to manufacture it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Evils of Models and Examples</i>.—But what
struck me most forcibly in those three books
was the vast amount of space given to models
and examples.  Stories were constantly being
laid upon the operating table, in whole or
part, and dissected and analyzed.  The pages
were strewn with dismembered parts, ticketed
and labeled, to be sure, and filed in most
orderly fashion, but the panorama as a whole
was enough to ruin a writer forever if it did
not drive him mad.  Oh yes, I know we must
take a clock apart before we can learn how
to make a clock, but an artist should live in a
studio, not an operating-room.  The use of
examples and models is a valuable adjunct
of teaching, but it is not teaching.  As far as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
I can learn from cursory glances from time
to time, through inquiry and through noting
results in submitted manuscripts, dissected
models and examples form the backbone of
teaching method.  Use them, by all means,
but only sufficiently to show the student how
to do his own analyzing when he feels the
need.  And teach him general principles to
make him keen to the need when it is there.
Teach <i>him</i> to work; don't litter his mind with
the work you've done on a third person's
work.
</p>

<p>
The mechanical method of teaching is perfectly
adapted to those students who by no
possibility can be anything but mechanical
writers, working by rule of thumb, building
a structure by foot-rule and pouring in its
contents from a graduated beaker.  But is
producing such writers worth while or even
justifiable?  Even if your purpose is the
broader, industrial one of adding to the
general earning capacity of the nation?  Of
course, if you are merely writing a text-book
that will sell—
</p>

<p>
It is upon the writers who are not doomed
by their own limitations to be merely mechanics
that the curse of mechanical teaching
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
falls.  The genius and the really strong
individualist will escape, but what of him with
moderate or even considerable gifts?  He
goes into the bed of Procrustes.  He is lopped
here, stretched there; he is badgered and
blinded with examples and precedents, kept
from natural development and natural
expression by the study of rules for growth and
by listening to other people express
themselves, prevented from being himself and
giving rein to his own individuality by the
constant study of individualities not his own.
If only you could sit for a year at some
editorial desk and see these poor maimed
fellows come in endless line with their pathetic,
lifeless wares!  Well-made stories, so much
so that they are almost exactly like all other
well-made stories, but in them here and there
a still unsmothered spark that might have
been a flame.  And after the procession has
filed up to you for a while it is not the
properly built stories they lay on your desk that
you see, but those countless other stories that
will never be laid on any desk.  It is like
looking out over the world of children who can
never be born, the better children, the dream
children, who could make the world so much
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
better if only they were here.  If you could
sit for a year at some editorial desk, you
would join with me in saying, "Damn such
teaching methods!"
</p>

<p>
<i>Individuality and Naturalness First</i>.—You
who are learning to write—and writers are
always learning if they are worthy of their
name—put this little rule at the head of all
your list of rules and let no rule that follows
seem to you one-half so well worth clinging
to: EXPRESS YOUR NATURAL SELF NATURALLY.
</p>

<p>
Believe me, it is worth clinging to, even at
the cost of aches and bruises.  As for all the
other rules, accept only those grounded solidly
in human nature and take for your guides,
not the rules, but their foundations.  If you
find yourself drifting into the stilted dialect
so many feel must be assumed on entering
the printed page, tear up what you have
written and say your say in your own words.
Maybe the result will be sad indeed; there are
always many things to learn.  But in your
learning you will find no secret of technique,
no trick of the trade, that is not second in
importance to the prime necessity of developing
and expressing your own individuality.
If they hold before your eyes some story by
De Maupassant, Stevenson, Kipling, O. Henry,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
look by all means and study what you see,
but be sure that your strongest reaction is,
"Yes, these are deft uses of tools, masterly
handlings of thought, and I will be awake to
similar opportunities in my own work, <i>but</i>
the fact remains that what I have seen is only
De Maupassant using his tools, Stevenson
using his, and the others each his own.  I am
not De Maupassant or Stevenson or Kipling
or O. Henry or anybody else except myself.
I can't possibly ever be any of them, and if I
try to be any of them I can't be even myself.
Perhaps their tools and devices are not the
ones best adapted to my case, though they
may prove valuable.  Now I'll go back to <i>my</i>
work."
</p>

<p>
And if they ask you to look at many other
workmen, refuse utterly.  Do your own looking.
You probably know far better than they
what it is you need to look for; if you don't
know where to look for it, then ask.  You'll
probably be looking enough without any one's
driving you to it.  And, always, when you
look, carry away with you only what you can
absorb.  Undigested food of this kind will
kill you.
</p>

<p>
<i>Being "Literary."</i>—Don't try to be "literary"
until you know what being "literary"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
really means.  Most writers do not know.
I'm not sure that I know, but certainly I know
a few things it is and a few things it is not.
</p>

<p>
It is not being queer for the sake of queerness.
It is not using large and learned words.
It is not getting as far away as possible from
the language of life.  It is not thinking, feeling
or talking artificially instead of naturally.
It is not the copying of others.  It is not either
wallowing in strong emotions or daintily
avoiding them.
</p>

<p>
It is telling things as you see or feel them.
It is using the words that accomplish this with
least lost motion, words so natural and familiar
you are <i>sure</i> they are exact to the case.
It is the preserving, developing and expressing
of <i>your own</i> individuality.
</p>

<p>
Style?  Be yourself and your style will be
born of itself.  Be anything else and, instead
of style, you will attain only an acrobatic
performance.  There are enough acrobats
already, and enough people who are not
themselves.
</p>

<p>
I should like to add, with some bitterness,
that a knowledge of plain English grammar,
even for writers who consider themselves
"arrived," is an almost necessary step toward
being "literary."

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
THE READER AND HIS IMAGINATION
</h3>

<p>
When you read a story you live more or
less in its story world.  There are printed
words on the page and they cause your
imagination (I do not use the word in the sense of
"fancy" but to indicate the mental power
that chooses and discards among certain
things to construct certain other things) to
build from your own experience a set of
mental images or impressions.  The story's
world becomes real to you in proportion as
the story's words succeed in making you
reproduce it in your mind.
</p>

<p>
<i>Variation in Visualization</i>.—But the
success of the story's words in doing this is
dependent not only on the skill and power of
their stimulus but also on <i>the ability of your
imagination to respond</i>.  Success is dependent
not only on the writer but on the reader.
</p>

<p>
Readers vary tremendously in the fundamental
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
ability of their imaginations to respond,
both as to quality and degree.  It is
surprising that this fact is so little known, for
its careful consideration is of the utmost
importance to success in writing fiction.  While
my questionings have been only casual, I
have not yet found either a writer or an
editor who took this variation as a serious
factor in his work or who had even discovered
the existence of the variation.  Wherefore
my gratitude is the deeper to Professor
Joseph Villiers Denney for having brought it
to my attention in a college class a quarter
of a century ago.
</p>

<p>
If you have not already investigated, make
the experiment upon your friends.  Ask
your friends what they <i>see</i> when they read a
story and you will find amazing variations.
Some visualize clearly everything mentioned
or suggested—see the characters, actions and
scene in full detail just as on a stage or in
real life.  Others see things and movement,
but without colors in their pictures.  Some
see people but without faces.  Some see
things only if, and only as fully as, described
by the author.  Some see fully even if the
author fails to describe.  Some make their own
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
images partly different from even definite
ones painted by the author, often because he
fails to impress his images first.  (In the
setting of a story, for example, haven't you, if
you visualize readily, had to change your
picture of the scene's geography or pick up
the whole setting and twist it around to
make north come where you had had east?)
Remember this when you are the author, and
save your readers this violence to the
illusion.  Some have a stock imagination-picture
that does service for a concept in
almost any circumstances.  Some see <i>practically
nothing</i>—can not shut their eyes and see
the very room in which they are sitting or
even the faces of their nearest and dearest.
</p>

<p>
I knew a high-school valedictorian who
easily mastered every subject until she came
to solid geometry.  In that study she could
not even make a start, was totally helpless—simply
because she was constitutionally incapable
of looking at the two-dimension
page and seeing, in her imagination, the
third dimension.  She got raw potatoes, cut
them up to represent the three-dimension
figures and had no further trouble.  Another
woman overcame the same difficulty
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
by the same vegetable route.  I know an artist,
very successfully designing stage-settings,
who can not "tell how things will look" unless
he looks at them, or pictures or models of
them, with his physical eye.
</p>

<p>
Yet most writers attempt to reach all these
types of imagination without giving the matter
a thought!  Generally they calmly take
it for granted that every one of their readers
has exactly the same qualities and limitations
of imaginative visualization as themselves!
What rich opportunities are lost!
Here is a matter in which you should <i>not</i>,
without very careful consideration, write
things merely as you see them, at least when it
comes to revision, unless your way of seeing
them happens to be the way that is most
effective with most people.
</p>

<p>
Each author has his individual qualities in
this respect.  When he paints his word
pictures he tends to use only as many strokes
of his brush as make a complete and satisfying
picture for <i>him</i>.  But how complete or
satisfying will that picture be to the majority
of readers who may not even approximate
his qualities of imaginative visualization?
The words he has set down give <i>him</i>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
the picture, but will they give it to others?
He can not test out the visualization of the
entire population, but he can at least assign
himself a fairly definite place in the relative
scale, scrutinize his word pictures from the
point of view of those of different powers
and probably revise his painting methods so
that his stories will gain surprisingly in
popular appeal, either by additional touches or
by changing the relative proportion of the
various kinds of stimulus.
</p>

<p>
A certain writer of western stories found
that his work made a strong appeal to those
it interested at all, but that the size of his
audience was far less than seemed justly
merited.  Apparently all the elements of
good fiction were present.  But, if he had
considered his readers' psychology in other
respects, he certainly had not done so as to
visualization.  He himself could reread his
words and from them see his story world in
full.  So could I, for we both happened to
have the type of imagination that visualizes
readily and fills gaps when needed.  But
many readers haven't this type and, as
finally became apparent, these were largely
the ones who had failed to become part of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
his normal audience.  For he had not drawn
any visual pictures for those who need them.
To them his story people were merely names
and dispositions, without clothes or bodily
appearance, that did dim things in unseen
places.  The author had deemed it waste of
words to describe things that were—to him—seen
of themselves.  It was difficult to get
him to "pad" his stories with visualizing
descriptions, but when he began adding them
his audience began to grow.
</p>

<p>
<i>Variation in Other Imaginative Powers</i>.—You
will find that probably a minority have
imaginations that reproduce not only visual
impressions but those of the other senses.
Some can hear the sounds of a story—not
merely have an intelligent concept of sounds
mentioned, but actually hear them almost as
clearly as if they were actual physical
sounds.  Some can taste <i>via</i> their imaginations,
with such vividness that their mouths
water.  Some can smell the odors in a story
they read.  Some can reproduce the impressions
that register through the sense of
touch—smoothness, friction, impact, pressure.
</p>

<p>
I hope to have for a later volume some
statistics that will give some idea of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
relative frequency of the reproduction of the
senses.  In any case, the great opportunity
for loss or gain of hold on readers offered
through visual imagination is considerably
multiplied by the cases of the four other
senses.  The field as a whole is so important
it is almost incredible that it does not play a
main part in all teaching of fiction writing.
Appeal to the senses may possibly be included,
though I've not chanced on it in my
cursory glances at text-books, but, as previously
stated, up to this writing I've happened
to find no writer who has even considered
the variation in sense-imagination among
readers.
</p>

<p>
I recall a statement in Professor Denney's
thesis class to the effect that analysis would
show the most popular poets, like Burns and
Longfellow, to be as a rule strongly marked
by their imagination appeal to all or most
of the five senses.  Is there any reason why a
similarly broad appeal in the case of prose
would not reap like results?  The case would
seem to be stated thus: The more fully you
reach a reader, the more fully you reach
him.
</p>

<p>
Suppose your imagination sees and hears,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
but does not smell, taste or touch.  Look at
one of your own stories.  Have you given
comparatively few pictures or stimuli to
your readers' visual and auditory imagination,
perhaps taking it for granted that all
readers would supply them fully and
satisfactorily, as you do?  Or have you, simply
absorbed in your own personal equation,
failed to put into your story any considerable
number of stimuli to smell, taste and
touch imaginations?  In either case,
consider how greatly you have weakened your
story.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
THE PLACE OF ACTION IN FICTION
</h3>

<p>
As people progress in culture there is a
strong tendency more and more to consider
physical action in fiction crude.  This is
unfortunate—and unthinking.
</p>

<p>
<i>Action Considered Unliterary</i>.—The cause,
I think, is twofold.  First, most of the
crudest published fiction relies to a great extent
on action.  It is natural and illogical to
construct the following syllogism:
</p>

<p class="quote" style="margin-left: 4em; text-indent: 0">
  All crude fiction is action.<br>
  Crudity is poor art.<br>
  Therefore action is poor art.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Second, as a race develops in civilization
and culture it nearly always tends to lose
vigor, drifts further and further away from
physical action and more and more into
ease, inactivity and softness.  It also tends
more and more to nicety and detail and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
away from the elemental.  Physical action is
elemental and inclined to sweep nicety and
detail aside.  Naturally both critics and
writers come to consider action crude,
something behind and beneath them.  Consequently,
as a rule, only the lower-grade writers
use much action.  Consequently action
stories as a whole sink to a still lower level.
Consequently readers feel still more justified
in considering action crude.  But is it?
</p>

<p>
<i>False Culture</i>.—Things would be vastly
simplified and improved if all who think
they know what really constitutes good
literature really did know.  Nine out of ten
have for sole standard the opinions of
others.  The "others" are fallible, many of them
distinctly unreliable.  The nine are, of
course, unable to tell whose or which
opinions are worth while.  None of them does
any real thinking of his own and most of
them do not even make the attempt.  There
are nine of them who do not to one who does
think and does know.  The resulting standard
is painful.  Also artificial and unsound.
</p>

<p>
A sad feature is that their methods tend to
unify their opinions and thus give them the
preponderating influence in shaping the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
opinions of all the people who don't pretend
to know.  Professional critics being
comparatively few, each critic sways many
sheep.  Also, the sheep have been referred,
rightly enough, to the <i>Atlantic</i> as the "most
literary magazine in America."  They accept
its standard without discrimination or
understanding.  If a piece of fiction is
different, in any way, from the fiction of the
<i>Atlantic</i>, they therefore consider it unliterary.
Worst of all, many of those who judge
by <i>Atlantic</i> standards have a bare bowing
acquaintance with that most excellent magazine.
</p>

<p>
Now the <i>Atlantic</i>, for all its scope and
splendid humanness, in some respects savors
of the library rather than of the rough
world at large.  Critics, being human, and
being generally compelled to do a lot of
criticizing, weary of the everlasting
fundamentals and seek relief in attention to the
niceties and curlycues, these being, also,
more plentifully at hand.  The sheep herded
by the critics and by the <i>Atlantic</i> "habit"
naturally come to look down, way down,
upon the action story.
</p>

<p>
Also, popular demand for action in fiction
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
continues strong.  It is a cardinal tenet of
the unliterary literary person's belief that
anything popular is therefore low.  I shall
not be surprised if some day all fiction that
interests in any way is condemned because
the popular demand is for fiction that interests.
</p>

<p>
Still another factor is at work.  In clinging
blindly to the classics as standards and
models many fail to discriminate either in
recognizing just which qualities in a classic
entitle it to lasting place or in allowing for
the difference between the time in which it
was written and our own times.  Some of its
qualities stand forever, but in many cases
other qualities lack that permanence of
appeal and are very distinctly tuned to its own
era.  Is the verbosity of a century or two ago,
or the sentimentality of the early Victorian
period, in key with the spirit and genius of
this century?  How could it be when our
whole civilization has rushed us into a
hundred fold greater speed and intensity,
surrounded us with a million incentives to
practical activity and hurry?  Railroads,
steamships, trolleys, autos, modern newspapers,
motion-pictures, telephones, telegraphs,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
wireless, electricity and machinery in
general, these have geared us to a far faster
pace.  We can no longer travel naturally in
stage-coaches.  <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>, allowing
it its excellencies, is no longer geared
to living man.  Therefore, in that respect, it
is not a classic, not permanent, should not be
even a subconscious model.
</p>

<p>
And in the choosing of books to be labeled
classics the natural inadaptability of the old
generation to the new, together with the
tendency to limit "literature" to products
refined away from elementals instead of merely
away from crudities, has still further cast
action into disrepute.
</p>

<p>
All in all, the action story has a pretty hard
time of it nowadays if it dares plead any
claim to being literature.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fundamental Tests</i>.—Yet, if the test of
literature be its permanent appeal to human
beings, regardless of changing times, the
action story fares at least as well as the best.
</p>

<p>
To be permanent an appeal must reach
the only things that are permanent and
universal in human beings, the only permanent
and universal things are the elementary,
fundamental ones, and "action" meets that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
test at least as well as anything else.
Undoubtedly the race was acting before it was
psychologizing or even talking.
</p>

<p>
If proof of this fundamental and everlasting
hold is needed, witness the wide-spread,
undying demand for action stories.  Also
note the fact that most of the classics that
have lived longest are crammed full of
action—Homer, Virgil, any of the epics or
sagas.  No, they don't live because of that
alone, but could they have lived without it?
</p>

<p>
If you think that, for all their culture, the
most sophisticated and literary specimens
among us have really grown beyond the
reach of the action appeal, you are much
mistaken.  Try them, when no one is looking,
with a good action story, even one
unsanctified as a classic.  Scratch the skin and
you'll find red corpuscles in even the most
anemic blood.  Somewhere deep in each of
them is the impulse to do, and the admiration
for doing.  As children they gave it natural
outlet; has the leopard changed his
spots?  Neither restraint nor veneer, neither
pose nor inactive living, can eradicate this
thing the child was born with.
</p>

<p>
I've particular reason to speak on that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
point.  <i>Adventure</i> was founded with the
primary purpose of meeting this action
demand on the part of the more cultured
classes, the people whose normal reading is
of the "highbrow" variety but who habitually
turn at odd moments to stories of action,
who accept "trashy" stories if no better
offer, but prefer stories sufficiently well
done to stand the test of their sophistication.
The fact that the magazine's secondary appeal
is to those of less literary sophistication
and franker interest in the elementals in no
way invalidates the primary aim or seems to
limit its success.  It is difficult to say which
of these classes is naturally the more given
to writing letters to magazines, but it is
difficult to say which of them is the more
heavily represented in my correspondence
basket.
</p>

<p>
The latter, I suppose, depends upon where
you attempt to draw a hard and fast line
between the two classes.  Professional men of
all classes form a large part of the
audience—physicians, lawyers, educators, scientists,
engineers, statesmen, ministers and priests;
letters from those of undoubted culture in
the ordinary sense of that word are very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
strongly in evidence; more than once the
definite, concrete statement has been
volunteered that "I read only two magazines—<i>Atlantic</i>
and <i>Adventure</i>."  Yet, personally, I
find it not always easy to say that this
general class has a keener sense for what seem
to me the essential literary values.  More
articulate and with better opportunity for
comparisons, yes; but with point of view more
obscured by their sophistication.  However,
there is no doubt as to the common action
appeal to both extremes of the audience, and
nearly a dozen years have eradicated my
last doubt of action response beneath even
the heaviest veneer of culture.
</p>

<p>
Its audience is about eighty-five per cent. men,
but other action magazines, aimed at
both sexes, have audiences nearly equally
divided as to sex.  Eliminate sex appeal, the
love element, and, even with women, action
appeal will take first place.
</p>

<p>
<i>What Is Fiction Elementally?</i>—Elementally
a story is a narrative.  A narrative implies
events, is a record of action, not a treatise,
a laboratory record or a post-mortem.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Rightful Place of Action in Literature.</i>—In
addition to its claim to place in the best
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
literature because of its fundamental and
permanent appeal and in addition to its
being the essence of narrative, there is one
thing more to be said.
</p>

<p>
In its crudest expression you may consign
it to what depths you please, but in its essence,
in its potentialities, I challenge you to
deny it the highest rank of all as material of
fiction.  For <i>action is the crystallization of
psychology</i>.  It is the ultimate, final expression
of character, of all a character has
thought, felt and said, of all a character is or
can be.  Physical action.  It need not be
exciting and adventurous.  It may be expressed
negatively, through repression.  But
psychology, character, morals, what you will,
none of these has been really born into the
world, has borne recognizable fruit, until it
has in some manner acted physically, or
taken physical shape through action.
</p>

<p>
It follows that, in literature at its best,
action must be the perfect, logical, inevitable
and complete result and register of all
psychology of the characters in relation to all
circumstances and conditions of the story.
No other element of literature has so difficult
a test to meet, for, aside from its own
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
demands, it must be <i>the final and exact
expression of everything else in the story</i>.
</p>

<p>
Yet the action story is sweepingly
condemned <i>as a type</i>!
</p>

<p>
<i>The Place of Action in Practise</i>.—Nothing
can make more plain the undiscriminating
contempt for action as fiction material than
the actual practise of most writers.  Action
being in its crude form the simplest material
as well as the most natural, the majority of
writers begin with it.  Generally, as they
gain in skill they develop, at about equal rate,
the idea that all action is crude and that real
progress lies in abandoning it as rapidly as
possible.  In many cases the result is merely
the absence of fairly good action stories and
the creation of very sad but very "literary"
productions.  In nearly all cases the cause of
the change is due to failure to understand
action's potentialities and rightful place,
and the result of that lack of understanding
is generally failure to produce the real
literature intended.
</p>

<p>
By all means try to rise above the crude
"Diamond Dick" type of action story, but be
sure you can substitute something better,
aside from improved technique.  Better a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
story of rather crude but convincing action
than a miserable mess of half-baked psychology
and falsely glittering "literary finish"
whose chief proof of literary quality
must be its freedom from physical action.
If you sincerely intend to do real literature,
get firmly into your head the truth that
action should be the perfect crystallization of
all else in your story and then use as much
or as little of it as is needed for that
crystallization.  If you try that, you will get an
extreme test of all the literary ability you can
summon, and if you succeed, you will have
attained what only the comparative few are
capable of attaining.  Even to make a start
you must rid yourself of the absurd idea
that action <i>per se</i> is unliterary.
</p>

<p>
<i>Popular Demand</i>.—Since the Great War
popular demand for action fiction is stronger
than ever, despite the strong antipathy for
material directly connected with it and
despite a definite reaction in favor of quiet,
peacefulness and things spiritual.
</p>

<p>
If it's popular demand you're considering,
consider this: Real life, perhaps now more
than ever before, consists very largely of
restraints and inhibitions.  Human nature is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
just as human as it ever was—there are just
as many things in it to be restrained and
inhibited.  And, underneath all our civilization,
we're just as tired of having to do
it—probably more so, since our civilization is
more civilized and therefore more exacting
than its predecessors.  If we can't escape
from the fetters in real life, can't be free to
follow our undoubted impulses, as readers
we'll all the more welcome a chance for
vicarious freedom.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
ADAPTATION OF STYLE TO MATERIAL
</h3>

<p>
If the theory suggested by the chapter
head had not withstood the test of ten years
and the judgment of a number of people
whose judgment is worth having, I should
not venture to present it here even in brief
space, for if carried into practise it would
more or less revolutionize the art of fiction.
Perhaps, too, it has already been advanced,
though I have never happened to run across
it or to hear of it through others.
</p>

<p>
In an earlier chapter was the statement
that the art process of fiction consists of
three steps—Material, Artist and Reader and
that the third step fails to get anything
approaching due consideration in either theory
or practise.  This book is largely an attempt
to emphasize this fact and a plea that the
reader be given greater importance in the
teaching of fiction writing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
</p>

<p>
While working out and testing this theory
of the reader's place in creative work I was
testing out also another theory which seemed
to have little connection with the first and,
with my perspective ruined by specialization,
it was only a year or two ago the almost
self-evident fact dawned upon me that the
two fitted neatly into each other and constituted
a complete theory of the art process.
Until then each had been locked away in its
own little compartment, there being no intent
of building up a rounded out whole.
</p>

<p>
While the first theory dealt with neglect of
the reader in the general art process, the
other centered on the neglect of material as an
influence on style.  In other words, writers
seemed too concentrated on themselves, the
Artists, in the creative process and too
neglectful of the two other steps, Material and
Reader.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rigidity of Style as to Material</i>.—To present
the matter briefly, all that an author has
to convey to you comes to you through a
single medium which we call his style and
which in practise is singularly inelastic in
relation to the great variety of things that must
pass through it.  Take Maurice Hewlitt in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
his earlier days when his accentuated and
highly individualized style make him a good
example.  Through that one unchanging
style had to come to you tragedy, comedy,
pathos, contemplation, action, love, hate,
patience, anger, romance, satire.  All the gamut
of human emotions in the material must be
crushed into uniformity of expression before
it could reach you, losing of its own essence
in the process.  All must be translated into
the one inflexible rhythm and jingle of that
one style—standardized, as it were, out of
much of their individuality and strength.
Such a loss is a calamity, and, I think, to a
marked degree unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
In poetry the need of guarding against this
loss is definitely recognized, if not as a broad
principle, at least in adaptation of sound to
sense and in selection of the metrical form
best adapted to a given theme.  Why should
it not be at least equally guarded against in
prose?  Many of the distinguishing qualities
of poetry as opposed to prose vary with
different races and with the march of time.  Of
the universal, permanent distinguishing
qualities are there any that should differentiate
poetry from prose as to the importance
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
of the Material's influence on style in
transmission of Material to Reader through
Artist?
</p>

<p>
That there are already in our fiction
occasional and sporadic cases of this adaptation
of style to material shows the soundness of
the theory, for these examples are evidently
not for the most part the result of studied
effort but instances in which the writer's art is
sufficiently developed to break through his
usual style and spontaneously adapt expression
to the thing expressed.
</p>

<p>
There are even stray rules pointing in this
direction, but chiefly for dialogue where a
demand for adaptation makes itself felt
through the need of making a character
express his emotions as a real person would
express them in real life.  For example, the use
of short sharp sentences and simple
Anglo-Saxon words in most cases of emotional
stress.
</p>

<p>
But if you wish an example of what adaptation
of style to material is capable of
accomplishing if used as a fixed and general
principle of composition, turn to Shakespeare,
forgetting the non-essential fact that
he is a poet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
</p>

<p>
<i>Style in Relation to Material</i>.—Style is the
expression of material through the artist, of
material as transmuted through his individuality.
He is, if you like, a part of his material,
but, on that basis, he divides cleanly
into two parts, one of them, the artist,
expressing the other, the material.  What I
object to is the attempt to express through a
single, inelastic style <i>all</i> of his material, <i>all</i>
of himself as material, or <i>all</i> of himself as
artist.  There <i>is</i> no one style that can even
approximate perfect expression of all that is
in the world.
</p>

<p>
Do tragedy, comedy, pathos, love, anger,
excitement, calm speak the same language
in real life?  Must not human art at least
approximate human life if only by a kind of
symbolism?  What writer, or any other
human being, can approximate expression of
all of himself through the intoning of any
one single style?  Does he go from cradle to
grave in one single chord?  Does he not
respond to emotions, his own or other people's,
as a harp to hand?  And yet, God save the
mark, when he comes to write he calmly
tries to squeeze death and all living into a
single monotone!
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
</p>

<p>
Is literature merely the click of a telegraph
key, crushing all juice from life to reduce
all life to its own inflexible code and
flat rhythm?  Is an author merely a funnel
through which all the juice of life must
emerge at the small end in a single thin
stream?
</p>

<p>
<i>Demands of Unity</i>.—Art's demand for
unity is fundamental and not to be denied,
but what has been our idea of unity of style?
Merely to whistle one note and call it a
satisfactory expression of the author and the
universe.  It can not be.  And to attain this one
note in a story we place no limit to the
violence needed to make all human emotions
give up their own individuality in order to
be in key.  It is well enough, as far as it goes,
but it is only a first crude step.  It is time
we took a step beyond.
</p>

<p>
Can any artistic demand for unity be based
on any elemental more fundamental and
indisputable than the irreconcilable difference
of opposite human emotions?
</p>

<p>
Let the author mold his material to his
individuality, unify it through himself, express
it through his individual style.  Let him mold
his material into unity around what single
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
thought or emotion he please before he
passes it through his style.  But let him make
that style, not a single inflexible note, but a
tune, a tune that sings high or low, loud or
soft, in majors or minors, harmony or discord,
fast or slow, expressing in delicate
response the varying emotions of its song
through the singer, itself a unity and an
expression and in each of its parts a unity and
expression of that part.
</p>

<p>
<i>Let Your Style Respond</i>.—If you are sincere
in your work, if you really feel your
material and if you are not so ridden and
oppressed by rules that you can not be natural,
your style will of its own accord tend to
attune itself to what it expresses.  Give it the
chance, encourage it to do so.  Let no rule of
misinterpreted unity force it into one
monotonous, inflexible note impervious to all the
emotions of the material that strive to break
through into expressions of themselves so
that they themselves can reach the reader in
something of the fulness and color of reality
instead of in the shape of cold line drawings.
</p>

<p>
Let your tune follow the moods of what it
sings about.  If in your material comes
tragedy after a grayness of every-day affairs,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
will your song ripple on in unchanged
measure?  Why not let the tragedy come through
into the song itself?  Let each mood of your
material come through into your song and
to your reader.  If there follows a relief
scene of comedy, how much of comedy will
fail to reach the reader if it fails to tinge
even the medium of transmission?
</p>

<p>
If you are not musician enough to compose
the various elements of material into your
style-tune, at least you can approximate by
the use of notes you know produce the
general effect and are keyed to the mood you
desire to reproduce in your reader—rhythm
changed to smoothness or harshness,
sentence-length changed to that generally used
in real life for the expression of that mood,
words chosen for slowness and weight or
speed and lightness, skilful use of adaptation
of sound to sense, few words for speed of
action, many for waiting and suspense.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Need of Emphasizing the Relation of
Style to Material</i>.—All these things are
done—a little—by a few.  These few are of the
real artists.  It is because they are real
artists that their material finds expression in
their style.  It is not because responsiveness
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
of style to material is systematically taught.
It should be, if American fictionists are to
attain the development their natural advantages
make possible to them.  It is the art of
artists that most deserves teaching so far as
it can be taught, particularly if it is so potent
that it pushes its way without encouragement
and against heavy odds of hindering
rules.
</p>

<p>
I have only outlined the need and the
possibilities and, I fear, made a poor case of it.
But some day some one else will give it full
and convincing presentation—if, indeed,
some one has not already done so outside my
knowledge.  In any case, there lies a line of
development that sooner or later fiction is
bound to follow.
</p>

<p>
Whether you believe it or not, give it slow
consideration in your mind.  Even if you decide
against it in the end, the considering of
it will teach you more concerning style than
you are likely to get from the study of other
people's rules.
</p>

<p>
Of <i>that</i> I am very sure.  In your case <i>you</i>
are the most important authority.  Appeal to
that authority and see that it gives judgment,
judgment reasoned out, by <i>you</i>, from fundamentals.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
Let no rules by other people impose
themselves until you have reasoned out
their worth.  Keep and develop your own
individuality.
</p>

<p>
And the one best way to learn to write is
to—write.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I hereby absolve you from all rules in this
book except such rules as warn against rules.

<h3>
APPENDIX
<br><br>
YOUR MANUSCRIPTS AND THE EDITORS
</h3>

<p>
To new writers, and to most old ones, a
magazine editorial office is, among other
things, a mystery, not the least mysterious of
its contents being the editors.  It is, of course,
no more mysterious than the office of any
other specialized business, and editors are
merely one small class among many classes
doing various kinds of specialized work.
Certainly there seems no justification for the
traditional awe in which editors are held by
so great a majority of people.  This awe is
undeniably present and does more than a
little to prevent more comfortable relations
between writers and readers on one hand and
editors on the other.  Partly it is a
"hangover" from a past age when editors better
earned an atmosphere of awe as individual
molders of public opinion, and partly it is
due to people's insistence on regarding with
a peculiar and undiscriminating reverence
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
anybody or any thing connected, however
remotely, with "literature."
</p>

<p>
It shouldn't be necessary to say so, but, if
the testimony of one of them can be accepted
by those who persist in considering them
something very much above—or below—the
normal, editors are just ordinary humans no
different in essentials from any other people
of ordinary education.  As in any collection
of people, there are all kinds among us, even
those who breathe a rarified atmosphere and
hold themselves superior to their fellows,
but, heavens, think of waiters you have
known!  While as to barbers and policemen—
</p>

<p>
Just humans, whose job happens to be that
of trying to choose from many manuscripts
those the reading public will like best.  If
the manuscripts they handle happen to be
fact articles as well as fiction, there is also
the job of selecting with an idea of education,
or of advancing some cause or principle
advocated by the particular magazine, but
even here there is also the job of pleasing the
reading public.  Besides that, if the editor
has a plain or social conscience, the desire to
leave people the better, rather than the
worse, for their reading.  That's all.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
</p>

<p>
A word more about that job, so that we
editors may not seem quite so mysterious,
inconsistent, arbitrary and other things as we
do at present.  Take the editor of any
fiction magazine—or any magazine, for that
matter.  So long as he works on that particular
magazine his job is, generally speaking,
not to test a manuscript by its general
literary or its general magazine merits, nor to
choose according to his own personal tastes,
but, to the best of his ability, to choose first
according to its suitability to <i>that particular
magazine</i>.  If John Jones is editor of magazine
B and then becomes editor of magazine
C, his manuscript tests will change instantly.
He will accept some stories he rejected
for B and reject some others that he
would gladly have taken for B.  That is, if
John is a good editor and has not
deliberately taken up the task of making C as
much like B as possible.
</p>

<p>
Each fiction magazine aims at a special
type of reader, or a special group of readers.
Therefore it tries to individualize itself in
such manner as to get and hold the interest
of <i>that</i> type.  Its "policy" may undergo
changes, but it is always a more or less
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
individualized one.  What is one magazine's
meat may be another magazine's poison.
</p>

<p>
There are other reasons why the rejection
of a manuscript is "not necessarily a
reflection upon its merits."  It may fall fairly
within the individualized field of a magazine
and be recognized by the editor as of
entirely sufficient merit, yet be sent back.  A
grocer or a druggist or a delicatessen man
acts exactly the same way.  If one hundred
cans of corn is the number a grocer is justified
by sales in carrying on his inventory
and he already has one hundred cans of corn,
he doesn't buy any more cans.  If an editor
estimates that his readers' demand justifies
him in buying about fifty love-stories, five
tragic stories, ten business stories, etc., per
year and he already has in stock the full
quota of each that should be on hand at any
one time, he, like the grocer, buys no more of
these types.
</p>

<p>
Length, as well as type, is also a factor
that an editor must consider in the light of
his inventory.
</p>

<p>
Of course, there are all kinds of exceptions
in applying the inventory test to manuscripts,
for stories are not standardized like
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
cans of corn nor do all magazines adhere to
so rigid a basis of selection.  Then, too, there
is the fact that some types are, permanently
or temporarily, difficult to secure and, when
sufficiently well executed, are likely to be
seized upon at any time.  Really good
humorous stories, being notoriously difficult to
find, would hardly be rejected even by a
magazine with its normal supply of humorous
stories already in the safe.
</p>

<p>
Also, manuscripts come in waves, not only
as to number but as to setting, material,
theme, and so on.  For six months, a year,
three years, there may be, for example, an
oversupply of stories of diplomatic life,
rural stories, stories laid in Latin America, and
a dearth of stories of golfing, stories of olden
times, sea stories.  By the end of a year or
two the situation may be completely reversed
on any or all of these types.  In most
cases the change from dearth to plenty or
<i>vice versa</i> is without warning or discernible
cause.  After being caught by a few dearths
an editor is likely to stock up with a reserve
on types that have shown themselves subject
to fluctuation in supply.  On the other hand,
he may decide that writers as a whole, in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
their fancy or lack of fancy for a type, are
a fairly safe index to the fancy of the public
in general.
</p>

<p>
In any case, many factors besides merit,
recognized or unrecognized, and besides bad
judgment by editors, decide the fate of
manuscripts.  On the other hand, most manuscripts
are rejected for the all sufficient reason
that they do lack sufficient merit.
</p>

<p>
Some ideas are prevalent that seem worth
meeting.
</p>

<p>
A "pull" is seldom of service in gaining
acceptance for manuscripts; of none at all
so far as my observation extends, and I can
not now recall, even from hearsay, any case
in which "pull" took the place of merit.
Doubtless there are such instances, but,
ethics aside, progress through "pull" is not
worth a writer's practical consideration.
Many beginners believe they will get a better
hearing for their stories if they present them
in person instead of mailing them.  It's an
editor's business to select manuscripts
according to their values, not according to his
opinion of their authors, and I think most
editors do so.  If he is subject to personal
influence, don't forget that you may make an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
unfavorable, instead of a favorable, impression.
In any case you're taking from him
time that he probably needs badly and is not
likely to be happy over losing.  What you
have to say to him can almost always be said
equally well by letter, perhaps far better.  A
letter takes less of his time and—he can
choose his time for reading it.
</p>

<p>
I know of no fiction magazine that has a
"regular staff" of writers in the sense of its
having no opening for new writers.  Often a
magazine comes to depend for the bulk of
its supply upon a comparative few who have
proved themselves best able to provide that
supply, but that does not mean that it hasn't
a welcome for others.
</p>

<p>
The oft-heard wail that "a new writer has
no chance with editors" is merely silly.
Weren't all the "old" writers once new?
How, pray, did they gain their first footing?
In one sense, to be sure, new writers have
little chance with editors for the sweet and
simple reason that a majority of beginners
haven't sufficient merit to earn them a
chance with any competent, fair-minded
judge.  Some of them will never have.  Some
have not yet developed and are worthless to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
magazines until they do.  If a writer can't
develop unless encouraged by acceptances
before he has developed, he almost surely
hasn't in him the ability to develop in any
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Don't be discouraged by rejections.  They
are merely the usual thing.  They only class
your manuscript among the eighty-five to
ninety-nine per cent. that every magazine
turns back.  Along with yours many
manuscripts of successful or even famous
authors are rejected, and some of these rejected
stories, possibly yours among them, will
be accepted by other magazines.  The only
disgrace is in being discouraged.  If, instead
of the usual printed slip, you get a note from
one of the staff, be glad, for your manuscript
has raised itself above the others and earned
attention for its merits; your rejection is
really a step forward—the big first step.
</p>

<p>
Often the beginner's discouragement is
due to his trying his wares on the wrong
market.  Would you try to sell a lady's slippers
to a civil engineer, a soldier's boots to a
dainty dame of fashion, a policeman's brogans
to a child?  Yet that is exactly what so
many of you try to do with manuscripts.  I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
am, though an editor myself, quite incapable
of saying just which magazines will buy
which manuscripts, for an infinite variety of
factors and circumstances are involved, but
the total ignorance of magazine markets
displayed by many beginners can be due to
nothing but failure to give the field even a
rudimentary consideration before trying to
master it.
</p>

<p>
The elementary rules for the actual
submission of manuscripts have been printed
thousands of times, but the need for them
abides:
</p>

<p>
Every manuscript should be typewritten.
No matter how good handwriting may be, it
imposes a heavy handicap on any manuscript,
for, in comparison with other manuscripts
in typewriting, its story can unfold
only on leaden feet even to the most patient,
kindly and self-sacrificing editor.
</p>

<p>
Double-space the typewriting.  It reads
more easily, allows you sufficient space to
make your own alterations and corrections
without messing parts of your story into
illegibility, and, if the manuscript is bought,
gives space for editing it as copy for the
printer to follow.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
</p>

<p>
Write on only one side of the paper.  This
custom is so firmly established that it's folly
to violate it and almost no one does.  There
are plenty of reasons for the custom, but its
mere existence is practical reason enough.
</p>

<p>
Leave a fairly wide margin on the left-hand
side of each sheet—as a kindness to the
editor in case your manuscript is bought and
to the compositor who must read and set
what you have written and the editor edited.
</p>

<p>
Type your name and address on the first
page of your manuscript.  For common-sense
reasons.
</p>

<p>
Number your pages.  Consecutively
straight through from beginning to end.
Especially if you hope for any chance of
detailed criticism from the editor.
</p>

<p>
Unless your manuscript is to be returned
express collect, enclose stamped,
self-addressed envelope of sufficient size and
strength, or at least sufficient postage.  As a
matter of common honesty.  A surprising
number of writers are not honest in this
respect.
</p>

<p>
If you write to the editor when you submit
a manuscript, see that the letter is enclosed
with the manuscript, not sent under separate
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
cover.  If your idea in writing is to further
the chances of your story, you're going about
it in a poor way if you add to the editor's
troubles by making him handle your case in
two parts instead of one.  Or by making him
read your autobiography in full.
</p>

<p>
Several things will help toward a better
understanding of the editorial attitude
toward manuscripts.  First, tell me, did you
ever know a merchant to work hard day
after day for the purpose of <i>avoiding</i> buying
stock for his customers' demands?  No, the
editor desires to buy; he spends his time
trying to get stories, not to avoid them.  When
he finds one that meets his needs he rejoices.
A minority of magazines seek first of all for
authors with "big names," because of the
following they command among the reading
public, but the editors of even these are
inclined to pat themselves on the back when
they "find" a brand-new author of merit.
</p>

<p>
Second, to balance the above, remember
that your manuscript is merely one among
thousands that come to an editor.
</p>

<p>
There is a wide-spread feeling that many
manuscripts are rejected only because they
are read, not by the editor himself, but by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P238"></a>238}</span>
some assistant.  There are two "schools" of
manuscript-reading.  One method is to let
the most inexperienced readers weed out the
bulk of submitted manuscripts, thus saving
the more experienced readers much time.
The other method reverses the process; a
more experienced reader does the first
sorting.  The latter seems to be gaining ground;
personally I believe in it strongly.  My own
experience may serve to illustrate the
situation.  For years every manuscript came to
my hands first.  As their number increased
this became a physical impossibility.
Manuscript-reading is only one of an editor's
many duties, a fact that many lose sight of.
At present from one to two working days per
week is probably a generous estimate of the
time I give to manuscript-reading.  The
reading is done mostly in bits—in the evenings,
on trains, in days spent at home for the
purpose.  In the office itself I can't get time to
read a dozen manuscripts a year.  And much
of the other kinds of work also is done
outside.  Many other editors are in similar case.
</p>

<p>
But in delegating the bulk of the work the
most experienced editor on the staff is the
one who first reads the stories from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P239"></a>239}</span>
"unknowns."  Except in cases of appeal, stories
by our "regular" writers do not pass through
his hands at all, but go first to editors of less
experience and from them to me.
</p>

<p>
Some magazines have a special "fiction
editor," who is often the court of final
appeal, may have been chosen by the editor as
superior to himself in this branch of editorial
work and may or may not be the first to
read manuscripts.
</p>

<p>
The thing to remember is that if the editor
delegates the first reading it does not follow
that he minimizes its importance and he
generally takes care to put it into as capable
hands as he can.  Remember, also, the general
rule is that a first reader is instructed
to mark all doubtful cases for a second hearing;
also that it's to his own personal interest
to "find" every good story he can if he
wishes to hold his job.
</p>

<p>
How much of a manuscript does a reader
read?  A sentence, a paragraph, a few pages,
maybe all of it.  Unfair and inefficient not
to read all of each?  My personal opinion is
that manuscript-reading is one of the things
that can be learned by experience only.  But,
having the experience, an editor can reject
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P240"></a>240}</span>
the "culls" very swiftly and with a good deal
of sureness.  He can tell all the hack plots at
a glance, knows the kinds of opening that
are never followed by a good story, can tell
in a few sentences or paragraphs whether a
writer has sufficient skill in handling his
tools to be able to turn out an acceptable
story and—has at his finger-ends all the
kinds of material, setting, plot, treatment,
etc., that his particular magazine does not
use.  If in doubt, he reads further or samples
it out here and there and glances at the
end.  If still in doubt, he reads it all.
Sometimes knowing the story to be unusable, he
reads it all because the author's possibilities
are worth serious consideration even if the
story in hand isn't.
</p>

<p>
As to the final reading I think, from what
data I chance to have, that I'm not in accord
with the majority custom.  When I'm familiar
with a writer's work and he's fairly
steady, the endorsement of the man who
passed it over to me is often sufficient, since
he too knows that writer's work and would
have noted any let-down or doubtful points.
In other cases, sometimes a few pages—with
maybe a glance at the remainder—is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P241"></a>241}</span>
sufficient for rejection, unless the other editor,
having read it all, has voted for it or makes
the point that we can help the writer revise
it into suitable shape.  But what I do read I
read word for word page after page until I
find definite cause for rejection, for I can't
believe that I can judge from the reading
public's point of view unless I read as I think
most of the reading public reads—word for
word.  Maybe other editors can, but, at least
in most cases, I can't.
</p>

<p>
But be sure of this—whatever their reading
methods, editors are trying to find good
stories, not to reject them.
</p>

<p>
Many magazines contract in advance for
stories by well-known writers, buying sight
unseen and trusting wholly to the writer's
steadiness, conscientiousness and popular
following.  In some cases this is perfectly
safe; in others decidedly not.  It means,
essentially, that the writer has left the merit
system and works on a sure-thing basis,
which is not good for most writers.
</p>

<p>
Do not decide that your story was rejected
because an editor read it when he was tired
or his liver was out of order.  Editors get
tired and their livers are as undependable as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P242"></a>242}</span>
anybody's liver, but they know this and
make allowances accordingly.  In fact, it's a
pretty safe rule to decide that your story was
rejected for lack of merit or for unsuitability
to the particular magazine.  If not convinced
of the former reason, keep sending your
story to other magazines.  Many a story has
been rejected by five, ten, twenty, fifty
magazines and yet found an acceptance, perhaps
by a better magazine than some of those that
rejected it, though the majority of
manuscripts submitted probably never find a
taker.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yes, the editor is fallible like everybody
else including yourself.  But after all
he's an expert of experience in his own
particular line, experience has given him a
perspective you lack, and he has an understanding
of his magazine's particular needs that
no outsider can have.  In the long run you'll
make progress faster if, allowing for the
fallibility of the genus editor, you decide to
accept his verdict as more dependable than
that of your friends or yourself.  Anyhow,
there's more to be gained from looking for
weak places in your work than from striving
to prove its excellencies by argument.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P243"></a>243}</span>
</p>

<p>
This is a rambling, hop-skip-and-jump
chapter, but there are a thousand little
points that bob up one after the other and
choosing among them is haphazard work at
best.  All I've tried to do is to give you a
sketchy idea of editorial offices and their
working so that sending manuscripts to them
will not be quite so much like sending them
out into a hostile unknown.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2 id="pg-footer-heading">THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</h2>

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
